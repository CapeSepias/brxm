 <section name='Restoring a previous version of a document'/>
     <span class='shortdesc'>How to replace the current content of a document with content the document had sometime in the past?</span>

   <span class='rewrite'>all text</span>

<p>
Finally the "Restore" button allows the user to replace the current document
with the content of a historic document.  Note that this does not mean that
the historic version of the document becomes the current version of the
document.  Only the content is restored, and the existing history of the
document is kept intact.
</p>

<p>
The Restore button is always available, but users which do not have full
rights to modify the document may not be able to restore the document this
way.  The workflow should in this case allow the user to request a restore
(this is not yet available as part of the reviewed actions workflow).
