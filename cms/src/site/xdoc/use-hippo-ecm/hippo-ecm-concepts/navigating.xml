                Hippo Repository is a fully jsr-170 compliant repository built
                on top of <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/">Apache
                Jackrabbit</a>. The content in Hippo Repository has some hierarchical
                structure (=Jackrabbit), which you can browse with any JCR browser (or with any
                WebDAV client in the future, see <a href="../roadmap.html">roadmap</a>). Hippo CMS/DMS is an
                example of such a browser. 
             </p>
             <p> 
                Browsing the content as it is stored hierarchically is out-of-the-box Jackrabbit
                functionality. Hippo Repository adds to this physical hierachical structure 
                as many views you want to add, exposing all these views jsr-170 compliant! Facetted
                navigation is an example of out-of-the-box view on the physical data.
