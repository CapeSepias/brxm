              <subsection name="Support for WebDAV browsers">
              <p> 
                  Currently, any jcr browser can navigate through Hippo Repository. A WebDAV 
                  compatible view will be added.
              </p>
              </subsection>
              <subsection name="Search Query GUI in CMS">
                  <p> 
                      Creating searches won't need XPATH or SQL skills, but will be created through
                      a CMS GUI in which you click together some search criteria, including preview of
                      the results. 
                  </p>
              </subsection>
              
              <subsection name="GUI for creating a facetted navigation">
                  <p> 
                      Currently, when creating a facetted navigation, you have to provide a
                      UUID from the physical node that indicates the 'root' of the content, and
                      add facets, like [hippo:author, hippo:year, hippo:location]. 
                      <br/>
                      Instead of having to <code>know</code> all properties, a GUI helping you
                      where you can drag drop the properties you want facetted navigation on will
                      be provided in short notice.
                  </p>
              </subsection>
              <subsection name="GUI for creating a facet select">
                  Just like for facetted navigation, you need to <code>know</code> some 
                  properties that are on nodes to build a proper facet select. For example,
                  when you only want published documents, you need to add a 'hippostd:state' to the 
                  hippo:facets property and add 'published' to the hippo:values property. 
                  <br/>
                  Obviously, instead of typing, a graphical view show you available properties and 
                  possible values will be added as a default Hippo CMS plugin.
