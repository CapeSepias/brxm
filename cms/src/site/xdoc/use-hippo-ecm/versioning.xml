<subsection name="Introduction">

<p>
Document in your system are most likely to change over time.  They get edited,
published, re-edited, removed, etcetera.  Versioning is the ability of the CMS
to keep track of the changes over time.
</p>

<p>
Certain events may trigger a copy of the then current document to be make.
This copy is read-only and stored in a different section.  Additional
information, such as the date the copy was made helps keeping a time-line of
the document over time.  These copies over time are called "versions" of the
document.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Creating versions">

<p>
Versioning is a core functionality of the repository.  It is by default
available, there is no configuration to be modified, nor does it need to be
enabled for documents.  This does however not mean that versioning is
automatic.  The event on which a version must be created of a document is not
a core function.
</p>

<p>
It is up to the logic of the custom workflow to determine whether or not a
version has to be created of a document.  The reviewed-actions workflow plug-in
has the following logic at this time: whenever a document is published a
version of that document variant (i.e. the published document) is created.
Depublication also involves the versioning to indicate no version of the
published document available.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="User perspective">

<p>
Users are normally not directly confronted with versioning.  Creating versions
is automatic as defined by workflow steps.  For instance, as a side effect
of the reviewed-actions workflow when publishing a document, a version of the
document is created.  This is transparent, and not unnoticeable for users.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not to create a version, needs to be part of the business model,
thus part of the workflow.
</p>

<h4>Browsing history of a document</h4>

<p>
Where the user is confronted with versioning, is if the user wants to view the
previous versions of a document.
</p>

<p>
The CMS can display a preview of the document while browsing.  When a
previewable document is selected in the document listing (middle pane) the CMS
can display the content.  You will see the following:
</p>

<center><img src="../images/versioning-pane.gif" alt="Versioning display screenshot"/></center>

<p>
Initially the current version is show.  With the "Older" link you can browse
back into previous versions of the document, or back again towards the most
current version using the "Newer" link.
</p>

<p>
When browsing like this, the content of the document of previous times is
displayed in the preview area.  Above it, in the gray scaled bar, information
about the version is shown.  The name of the article is shown (which is
constant over all versions, only the current name is shown, renaming or moving
a document is not part of the document history of the document itself but --if
available-- part of the document in which a document is embedded).
</p>

<p>
Furthermore a version number is indicated, which counts from 1, the first
version of a document created towards the most current document, which does
not have a version number yet.  It will show the date and time, when a
historic version of the document was created and until when that version of
the document was the most current document.
</p>

<p>
Note that this is not the same as when the next current document was created,
as it may be that there was no current document in the document history.
</p>

<p>
This happens for the reviewed-actions workflow.  Upon publication of a
document a version of the then current published document is created.  However
if the document is depublished, there is no longer a published version of the
document.  The ability of the Hippo ECM suite is to be able to deal with this
and indicate that in that point in history there is no version.  This
supersedes plain versioning in JCR.  Hippo does however use plain versioning,
so other clients not using plain JCR are able to use the same functionality,
albeit with less user intuitiveness.
</p>

<h4>Restoring a previous version of a document</h4>

<p>
Finally the "Restore" button allows the user to replace the current document
with the content of a historic document.  Note that this does not mean that
the historic version of the document becomes the current version of the
document.  Only the content is restored, and the existing history of the
document is kept intact.
</p>

<p>
The Restore button is always available, but users which do not have full
rights to modify the document may not be able to restore the document this
way.  The workflow should in this case allow the user to request a restore
(this is not yet available as part of the reviewed actions workflow).

<subsection name="Versioning invocation as part of a workflow step">

<p>
Although the JCR interface for versioning can be used, the main usage
interface for versioning is part of a workflow step.  It is the logic of
(custom) workflows to determine when a version of a document must be checked
in.  Workflows are written as plain Java code, as explained in X.  When such a
custom workflow is invoked it may indicate that a version must be created of a
document by in its turn invoking the internal workflow for versioning.  This
versioning workflow is a built-in workflow that has no direct representation
in a CMS front-end, but is meant to be used from within another workflow.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you have the following workflow implementation that marks a document
as "verified":
</p>

<source>
  public class VerifyWorkflowImpl extends WorkflowImpl implements VerifyWorkflow {
    VerifyableDocument theDocument;
    public void verified() {
      theDocument.verified = true;
    }
  }
</source>

<p>
Which comes with the interface for remote access and the implementation of the
document, similar as described in X.<br/>
Then you can modify this workflow to invoke the workflow to create a version
upon verification as such:
</p>

<source>
  import org.hippoecm.repository.standardworkflow.VersionWorkflow;
  public class VerifyWorkflowImpl extends WorkflowImpl implements VerifyWorkflow {
    VerifyableDocument theDocument;
    public void verified() {
      theDocument.verified = true;
      VersionWorkflow workflow = (VersionWorkflow) getWorkflowContext().getWorkflow("versioning");
      workflow.version(); // this commits the current document as a version
    }
  }
</source>

<p>
This shows the ability for workflow steps to invoke other workflows.  This
chaining of workflow steps, although looking very similar to plain method
calls, is slightly different.  Instead of invoking the workflow step directly,
it schedules the called workflow to be executed directly after the current
workflow and within the same transaction.  This means that it is not possible
to use the return values.
</p>

<p>
The versioning workflow is available on any document (it is based upon the JCR
type hippo:document) in the category "versioning".
</p>

<p>
The API of the versioning workflow is available in the Javadocs.
</p>

<p>
All packaged products of Hippo ECM have at this time versioning workflow
pre-configured in the category "versioning".  Versioning is a core function of
the repository and not a separate plug-in.  Versioning is however part of a
workflow configuration, in order for custom workflows to decide when a version
of a document needs to be checked in (i.e. created).  The following
</p>

<source>
[repository root]
`-- hippo:configuration
    `-- hippo:workflow
        `-- versioning [hippo:workflowcategory]
            |-- version [hippo:workflow]
            |   + hippo:display = Versioning workflow
            |   + hippo:classname = org.hippoecm.repository.api.Document
            |   + hippo:workflow = org.hippoecm.repository.standardworkflow.VersionWorkflowImpl
            |   + hippo:nodetype = hippo:document
            |   `-- hippo:types [hippo:types]
            |       `-- org.hippoecm.repository.api.Document [hippo:type]
            |           + hippo:classname = org.hippoecm.repository.api.Document
            |           + hippo:display = Document
            |           + hippo:nodetype = hippo:document
            `-- revert [hippo:workflow]
                + hippo:display = Versioning workflow
                + hippo:classname = org.hippoecm.repository.api.Document
                + hippo:workflow = org.hippoecm.repository.standardworkflow.VersionWorkflowImpl
                + hippo:nodetype = nt:frozenNode
                `-- hippo:types [hippo:types]
                    `-- org.hippoecm.repository.api.Document [hippo:type]
                        + hippo:classname = org.hippoecm.repository.api.Document
                        + hippo:display = Document
                        + hippo:nodetype = hippo:document

<p>
Version storage much be enabled for versions of a document to be stored.  This
is enabled by default.  This does however imply that even though versioning is
not used at all, some information is stored in the version storage.  If you
have a custom deployment, your version storage might be removed.  When
versioning does not seem to work, it needs to be verified if the version storage
is present and active.
</p>

<p>
Disabling the version storage is a practice to avoid the additional storage
overhead of versioning.  The reason for disabling the version storage is that
it is always used, even if no actual versions are stored.  So if an deployment
wants to avoid the storage overhead, and does not require document versioning,
the versioning can be disabled.
