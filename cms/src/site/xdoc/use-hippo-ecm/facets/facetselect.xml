    <section name="Faceted selection">
      Note:
      <source>
         Faceted selection and faceted reference are used intertwined and refer to the exact same thing.
      </source>
      <p>
        Faceted selection gives you the possibility to browse through your filtered hierarchical physical content (and virtual content, but we'll keep this
        for advanced content modelling). The filter is based on facets (metadata) on documents. An example would be, that you only want to 
        show documents which are english and published. By creating some smart faceted selections, you can
        very easily create websites which are multilingual, and have a preview/live or any other state in between.
        Exposing your DMS with faceted selection and authorization (and even facet search combined!) gives you a lot of 
        flexibility in exposing your (unstructured) physical content in many different (virtual) structured ways.

        Suppose we have the same hierachical repository data as with the <a href="/site/use-hippo-ecm/facets/facetsearch.html">facet search</a>, so:
        </p>
        <source>
Folder                       Type      Size      Age
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pets                           
|-- Dogs                           
|   |-- dog1                 Dog       Large     Adult          
|   |-- dog2                 Dog       Medium    Adult       
|   |-- dog3                 Dog       Small     Young
|   `-- dog4                 Dog       Large     Adult
|-- Rabbits
|   |-- rabbit1              Rabbit    Large     Young
|   |-- rabbit2              Rabbit    Large	  Old
|   |-- rabbit3              Rabbit    Small     Young
`-- Horses
    |-- horse1               Horse     Small     Young
    |-- horse2               Horse     Large     Young
    `-- horse3               Horse     Large     Old
        </source>  
        <p>
           Now, suppose, I want to browse through the data, but a filter applied to only show <code>large animals</code>. This is
           realized by simply creating a facet select node that indicates to only show animals which are of size 'large'. Suppose 
           that my facet select node is called 'IsLarge', then my navigation would look like: 
        </p>
          <source>
Folder                       Type      Size      Age
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IsLarge
`-- Pets                           
    |-- Dogs                           
    |   |-- dog1             Dog       Large     Adult  
    |   `-- dog4             Dog       Large     Adult
    |-- Rabbits
    |   |-- rabbit1          Rabbit    Large     Young
    |   |-- rabbit2          Rabbit    Large	  Old
    |-- Horses
    |-- horse2               Horse     Large     Young
    `-- horse3               Horse     Large     Old
          </source>            
      <p>I might also have a facet select node which filters such that I get 'large' and 'young' only. Then, my navigation would be</p>
        <source>
Folder                       Type      Size      Age
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IsLargeAndYoung
`-- Pets                           
    |-- Rabbits
    |   `-- rabbit1          Rabbit    Large     Young
    `-- Horses
        `-- horse2           Horse     Large     Young
        </source>
        
      <p>Obviously you can have as many facet select nodes as you want. What we did not yet explain, is that
      you do not need to have the facet select starting filtering on the root node. You can also make a facet select node, that
      filters for only 'large' animals, and has starting point /Pets/Dogs. This would result in a navigation like:</p>
      <source>
Folder                       Type      Size      Age
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IsLarge
|-- dog1                     Dog       Large     Adult  
`-- dog4                     Dog       Large     Adult
       </source> 
        <p>
          You can even have a facet select, which filters a hierarchical tree which contains in turn another facet select. So, you can have facet selects in facet selects. 
          Instead of a facetselect in a facetselect, you can have a <a href="/site/use-hippo-ecm/facets/facetsearch.html">facetsearch</a> node <b>inside</b> the result of a facetselect node!
          From this facetsearch node on, faceted navigation will be displayed.
          <br/>
          By understanding the possibilities, you can model endless combinations of structured data resulting from unstructered data. Obviously, under water all documents
          are being checked wether the user is authorized to see the document. 
          <br/>
          Take a look at advanced content modelling to learn about possibilities and use cases. Note 
          that you might want to look at it twice because it is not trivial. In the end, understanding
          modelling of data on unstructured data will give you an enormeous freedom and enables you developing 
          complex frontend websites or expose a DMS without writing code.
