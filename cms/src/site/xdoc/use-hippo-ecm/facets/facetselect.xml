      <p>
        Faceted selection gives you the possibility to browse through your filtered hierarchical content. The filter
        is based on facets on documents, ie on their meta data. An example would be, that you only want to 
        show documents which are english and published. By creating some smart faceted selections, you can
        very easily create websites which are multilingual, have a preview/live or any other state in between.
        Exposing your DMS with faceted selection and authorization (and even facet search combined!) gives you a lot of 
        flexibility in exposing your content.
