            <p>
                Projects that produce a WAR can be run inside the tomcat container that is included with Netbeans.  If you want
                to run several projects concurrently, each should get a separate context path.  You can e.g. run the frontend
                application and the repository inside the same container.  This can be achieved as [project right-click] -&gt; Properties
                -&gt; Run
            </p>
            <p>
                The netbeans memory limit may should be set to a reasonable size (say, 512Mb) to run the included tomcat container 
                comfortably.  This is specified by <code>-J-Xmx512m</code> in the netbeans_default_options parameter
                in <code>etc/netbeans.conf</code>, found under the netbeans installation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> project dependencies are not automatically handled.  I.e. if a source file changes, all projects that use the
                containing package must be rebuilt in the correct order.  (maven itself has the same limitation)
