    <section name="Usages for Hippo ECM">

      <subsection name="Introduction">

        <p>Hippo ECM can be used in a wide variety of cases, and can be tailored where needed. Hippo
          does not enforce structure, although it does bring clarity in the enormous amount of
          content that users have to cope with on a day to day basis. Some of the most common usages
          are listed in this section. </p>

      <subsection name="Using Hippo ECM for Document Management">
        <p>Out of the box, Hippo ECM provides Document Management functionalities that allows users
          to share and collaborate on documents. Hippo ECM extends standard Document Management
          functionalities by allowing users to organize all information in a way that is most useful
          to themselves or to the group they participate in, without forcing anyone to use a certain
          predefined structure.</p>
        <p> By using the Hippo ECM Faceted interface, anyone can start adding documents in no time
          without having to worry about the structure in which information should be stored. </p>
