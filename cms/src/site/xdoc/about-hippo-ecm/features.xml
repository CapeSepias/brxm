      <p> 
        Hippo Repository ships with numerous (customizable) default features, such as workflow,
        access management, authorization, versioning, document templates, and 
        <a href="#Faceted Navigation">faceted navigation</a>.

        <p> 
          Hippo Facet Navigation works out of the box. Browsing through authorized faceted
          navigation gives you multiple ordered views with the number of occurences on your
          (unstructured) physical data. One single document can be found via multiple faceted paths.
          Users do not have to think about structuring the content in a hierarchical of taxonomic
          order, but rather the structure evolves organically based on meta data and the users'
          authorisation. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          The Hippo Facet Navigation works extremely fast for a faceted view with counting and
          authorization. The view renders as if you are clicking through a cached File System. <br/>
          Hippo Facet Navigation includes user based faceted authorisation which makes it very
          powerful as a DMS, where instead of users having to worry about structure, they browse to
          their specific content the way they want.
