        <p>
          Creating and editing document types using the <a href="editor.html">document type editor</a>
          is very straightforward. This tutorial will guide you through creating your first
          document type, and show how easy it actually is!
        </p>
        
        <subsection name="Creating your first document type">
        
        <ul>
          <li>Log in to Hippo CMS as 'admin'.</li>
          <li>Select the 'Browse' tab by clicking on the folder icon on the left side of the screen.</li>
          <li>
            Select 'Configuration' in the first column. One or more so-called 'namespaces' will be
            listed. Each document type exists in exactly one namespace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the namespace for your project, or create a new namepace. If you are using
            the <a href="../../quickstart.html">Quickstart package</a>, just select the 'defaultcontent'
            namespace. The document types inside the selected namespace will be listed in the
            second column.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create a new document type by choosing 'Create new type' in the dropdown menu.
            </p>
            <img src="../../../images/extension/document-types/tutorial-create-new-type.png" alt="screenshot detail of 'create new type' action"/>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Name the document type 'person' in the dialog that appears, and click 'OK'.
              The new 'person' document type will appear in the list in the second column from the left.
            </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            Select the newly created 'person' document type by clicking on its name. A tab will appear
            showing the document type's fields. Since you just created the type, it has no fields
            so it will show empty in the tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on 'Edit' to open the document type in the <a href="editor">editor</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
