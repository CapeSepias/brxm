 <section name="Configure Workspace">
  <span class='shortdesc'>Configure Eclipse Workspace for Hippo projects.</span>

  <p>An Eclipse workspace is a foldertree that contains information Eclipse
   keeps of some of your projects. Eclipse will make all projects in a single workspace
   available simultaneously, which will require memory that depends on the number of
   projects in the workspace.
  </p>

  <subsection name='Identify Maven local repository'>

   <p>You need to have <a href='install_maven.html'>installed maven</a>.
   </p>
   <p>Ensure that a folder intended as Eclipse workspace for Hippo CMS addon projects exists.
    You can just create it, or <a href='start_eclipse.html'>start Eclipse</a> and have Eclipse
    create it.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the rest of this document, this folder will be called <code>$WORKSPACE-PATH</code>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Have Maven tell Eclipse where it can find your local Maven repository by opening a command shell and running:
   </p>
   <source>&gt; mvn -Declipse.workspace=$WORKSPACE-PATH eclipse:add-maven-repo</source>

   <p>Maven will download maven-eclipse-plugin-#.#.#.jar and depencies.</p>
