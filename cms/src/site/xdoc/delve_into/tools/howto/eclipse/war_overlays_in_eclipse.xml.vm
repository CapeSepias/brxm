 <section name="War overlays in eclipse">
  <span class='shortdesc'>How to use War overlays in eclipse</span>

      <p>
        The Hippo ECM Maven build extensively uses
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/examples/war-overlay.html">WAR overlays</a>.
        In order to mimic this for Eclipse, some scripts have been made that create symbolic links for these overlays.
      </p>

<div class='nav'>

  <tr>
   <td>Web</td>
   <td>
     <span class='web-48 icon-48'/> 
   </td>
   <td>If you have not yet downloaded the Hippo CMS sources and you are interested in 
    reading the scripts first, you can open them at:
    <a href="${project_source_url}/${last_release}/tools/eclipse/createlinks.bat">createlinks.bat (Windows)</a>
    and
    <a href="${project_source_url}/${last_release}/tools/eclipse/createlinks.sh">createlinks.sh (Unix)</a>.

    You need to have <a href='../get_Hippo_CMS_source.html'>checked out the Hippo CMS source</a>.
    In the following, it is asssumed that the Hippo CMS source is in your local <code>~/cms/</code> folder. 
    (<code>~\cms\</code> in Windows).

   This step is only required in Windows. Install the
   <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx">junction</a> tool from 
    the Microsoft technet site.  <!-- Was:  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/fileanddisk/junction.mspx">junction</a>. -->
    This tool allows to create symbolic links in Windows.
    If you prefer not to install junction, the alternative is to manually copy the linked directories.
    Please note that this has to be done every time there is an update in the linked directory. See
    the script for what needs to be done.
