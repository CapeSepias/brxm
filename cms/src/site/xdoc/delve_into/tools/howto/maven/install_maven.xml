    <section name="Install Maven">
     <span class='shortdesc'>Howto install Maven.</span>

        <p>
         All addons on top of Hippo CMS are built using Maven 2 (version 2.0.9 or newer). 
         To install Maven
         follow the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Maven installation instructions</a>.
        </p>

        <div style="border:1px solid black; padding:1em;">
          <p>
            <b>For Windows users</b>
            <br/>
            You need to take care that your local Maven 2 repository is not located in a folder with
            spaces in the pathname. The default Maven installation procedure will locate
            it in your home directory which on Windows is a subdirectory of the
            "Documents and Settings" directory.  This means that you need to relocate your local Maven repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create and edit the file
            <b>c:\Documents and Settings\&lt;Your Name&gt;\.m2\settings.xml</b> with the following content:
          </p>
<source>
<![CDATA[
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <localRepository>C:\\mvnhome</localRepository>
</settings>
]]>
</source>
          <p>
            This effectively relocates your local Maven repository to <b>c:\mvnhome</b>.
          </p>
        </div>
