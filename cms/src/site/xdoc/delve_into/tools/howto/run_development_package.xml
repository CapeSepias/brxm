   <section name="Run a development package">
    <span class='shortdesc'>How to run a  ?</span>

        <p>
         In production, the Hippo CMS and any addons are run by <a href="../../sysadmin/installation/in_servlet_container.html">
         deploying the application wars in an application server</a>, but during development you will
         want to have a faster way, testing and improving your application often during your
         development cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
         To facilitate development it is possible to run Hippo CMS together with any
         addons using maven commands and kill the running CMS using Ctrl-C.
         Assuming that the project directory is '~/cms':
        </p>
        <source>
&gt; cd ~/cms
~/cms&gt; mvn install
~/cms&gt; cd quickstart/war
~/cms/quickstart/war&gt; mvn clean jetty:run-war
        </source>
        <p>
         Maven uses the application server Jetty, which is included with Maven.
         The <code>mvn install</code> is required to put all project artifacts (jars, wars) in your local
         maven repository, as required by the maven-jetty-plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jetty and the Hippo CMS have now started and the CMS can be accessed via
         your web browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080/cms/">http://localhost:8080/cms/</a>,
         loging in as admin/admin.
        </p>
    <p>
      Note that in the sample application started from the command line is a quickstart version of
      the Hippo CMS suite.  If you require a production build, want to extend Hippo CMS or just
      want a clean start you should use the cms/package/war of cms/package/ear project.
