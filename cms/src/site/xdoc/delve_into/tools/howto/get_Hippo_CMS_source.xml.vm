  <section name="Get the Hippo CMS source">
   <span class='shortdesc'>Get the Hippo CMS source from the Hippo subversion repository.</span>

   <p>To create your own package on top of Hippo CMS, you have to check out the Hippo CMS source and
     include it in your package.
     <span class='expire'>When Hippo CMS can be used by addons as a package</span>The plan is that in the future,
     a Hippo CMS EAR package will be usable by your addon package, but that is not yet possible.
   </p>

   <p>
    The Hippo CMS source can be found at <a href="${project_source_url}">${project_source_url}</a>
    and can be anonymously checked out using any <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> client.
    Instructions on Subversion use can be found at <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>.
    The following command checks out the last release to a directory called 'cms'. That directory is not supposed to exist.
   </p>
   <source>
     &gt; svn checkout "${project_source_url}/${last_release}" ~/cms
   </source>
   <p>The 'checkout' argument can be abreviated to 'co'. You can not checkin (commit) your changes on this adress.
