       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
           You may have configured your servlet container to run on a non-default port.
     </p>
         <p>The examples in the documentation assume default values. You must adapt the examples to
            your own customized port number. 
        </p>
    </li>
        <li><p>You may be deploying the application on a machine other than your local
               machine.</p>
             <p>The examples in the documentation assume that you deploy the application on the same machine
                as you are working. If you are deploying the application on a remote machine, you  
                have to use the name of that remote machine everywhere that the documenation refers to &quot;localhost&quot;.
             </p>
    </li>
       </ul>

      <subsection name='The browser window of the CMS is an empty page'>

        <p>You maybe trying to run more than one CMS without configuring the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation'>RMI</a> ports appriopiately.
           In this case the second one that the servlet container or application server tries to start will crash.
        </p>

        <p>The CMS opens a RMI connection and normally uses the default port 1099 for that. If you want to
           run more than one CMS at the same time, you must configure one of them to use another port for
           the RMI connection.   
        </p>

   
      <subsection name='Configuration file syntax error'>
    
       <p>                 
         Some users reported the following error on startup:
       </p>
         <sample>
           Configuration file syntax error.: Premature end of file.
     </sample>
        <p>
           This can be resolved by adding the following two jars to the Tomcat 
           endorsed lib folder in common:
        </p>
         <ol>
          <li><a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven/xalan/jars/xalan-2.7.1.jar">xalan</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven/xalan/jars/serializer-2.7.1.jar">xalan serializer</a></li>
         </ol>
