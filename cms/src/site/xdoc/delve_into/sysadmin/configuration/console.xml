        <p>
          The console application provides a simple interface to browse
          the repository and edit its contents.  Most of the configuration
          is accessible this way, see the
          <a href="nodes/index.html">Configuration Nodes</a> page for more
          details on what can be found where.
        </p>

        <p>
          The console can normally be found under
          <a href="http://localhost:8080/console">http://localhost:8080/console</a>.

        <p>
          The application is based on the concept of "the selected node".  This is
          the JCR node that is selected in the tree.  The main panel shows
          properties and node type information and allows you to edit those.
          The menu operations are also based on this node:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li><code>Add Node:</code> adds a child node</li>
            <li><code>Delete Node:</code> deletes the node</li>
            <li><code>Move Node:</code> move the node</li>
            <li><code>Copy Node:</code> copy the node</li>
            <li><code>Rename Node:</code> rename the node</li>
            <li><code>Export Node:</code> export to XML</li>
            <li><code>Add Property:</code> add a property to the node</li>
            <li><code>Save:</code> save the node and its descendants</li>
            <li><code>Reset:</code> reset the node and its descendants</li>
          </ol>
