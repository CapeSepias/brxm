            <p>
                The Workspace element is used as a template for separate workspace configuration files created
                for each new workspace.
                Because of this the Workspace element is not interpreted directly from the repository
                configuration file. Instead the workspace configuration template is first copied into the
                workspace configuration file which is then interpreted to set up the configured workspace
                components. Thus modifying the workspace configuration template in the repository configuration
                file will not affect existing workspace configurations.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example JackRabbit workspace configuration can be found in the
                <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jackrabbit-configuration.html">Jackrabbit documentation</a>.
                Hippo Repository has a custom workspace configuration for enabling fast faceted navigation through
                custom indexing. The main differences with a default JackRabbit workspace configuration are
                the SearchIndex class and indexingConfigurationClass. See <a href="searchindex.html">Search Index configuration</a> for
                explanation of all &lt;SearchIndex&gt; parameters.

                    The minimal Hippo Repository workspace configuration looks like:

&lt;Workspace name="${wsp.name}"&gt;
    &lt;FileSystem class="org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.local.LocalFileSystem"&gt;
        &lt;param name="path" value="${wsp.home}"/&gt;
    &lt;/FileSystem&gt;
    &lt;PersistenceManager class="org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.db.DerbyPersistenceManager"&gt;
        &lt;param name="url" value="jdbc:derby:${wsp.home}/db;create=true"/&gt;
        &lt;param name="schemaObjectPrefix" value="${wsp.name}_"/&gt;
    &lt;/PersistenceManager&gt;
    &lt;SearchIndex class="org.hippoecm.repository.FacetedNavigationEngineThirdImpl"&gt;
        &lt;param name="indexingConfiguration" value="indexing_configuration.xml"/&gt;
        &lt;param name="indexingConfigurationClass" value="org.hippoecm.repository.query.lucene.ServicingIndexingConfigurationImpl"/&gt;

                <b>Note:</b>
                <br/>
                At the moment of this writing indexing_configuration.xml is needed, but only used for a namespace lookup.
                Currently, every JackRabbit property is indexed as a possible facet. Through this indexing_configuration,
                a subset of nodes can be configured to be facets, which is more efficient. Also defining the type of facet
                (date, long, etc) must be configurable, as well as some derived facet type (for example week number instead of
                the date to have faceted navigation on). For M4, the indexing_configuration.xml is planned to be replaced
                by configuration in the repository itself.
                See <a href="searchindex.html">Search Index</a> for further explanation.
