      <span class="shortdesc">An introduction to content add-on development.</span>

      <p>
        As you are developing the website, you'll need to be able to extend
        Hippo CMS.  Perhaps you have created your own 
        <a href="../../user/information_architects/howtoi/document_types/index.html">Document Type</a>, a
        <a href="">[FIXME] site map</a> or some documents with test data.
        It is possible to capture this work in an add-on, thereby making
        it possible to use version control, use an automated build process, share
        your work with the <a href="http://forge.hippo-ecm.org/">community</a>,
        etcetera.
      </p>

      <p>
        The repository can be extended in numerous ways.  Its content can be
        read from (multiple) XML files, new namespaces can be defined and
        additional workflows can be installed.  We'll discuss the different
        types of add-on that are typically used during website development.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Content add-on">
        <p>
          The simplest of add-ons, this type contains only a handful of files that
          are imported by the repository at startup. These files can contain JCR trees, in
          the format that is exported by the 
          <a href="../../sysadmin/configuration/console.html">CMS console</a>'s
          "Export Node" action.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Editing Template add-on">
        <p>
          Any repository add-on can also contain a namespace definition with
          node types.  These add-ons contain the types as created with the
          <a href="../../user/information_architects/howto/document_types/index.html">Document
          Type Editor</a>.  See the <a href="howto/editing_template.html">tutorial
          on how to create a template addon</a> for more information.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="More">
        <p>
          In a more advanced project, document types get complex and their
          templates may need to be customized.  You can find more information about
          <a href="../../custom/howto/customize_editing_template.html">how to create
          a custom layout</a> or maybe even
          <a href="../../custom/howto/editing_template_plugin.html">how to create
          your own editing plugin</a> in the <a href="../../custom/index.html">CMS Customization</a> section.
