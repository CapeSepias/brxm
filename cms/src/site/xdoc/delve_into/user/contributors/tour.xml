 <body>
  <section name="Hippo CMS Contributor Tour">
    <span class='shortdesc'>To get introduced in the role of CMS Contributor, take the following tour.</span> 

     <p>To get introduced in the role of CMS contributor, you will look over the shoulder of
        Marc, who is a member of the imaginary organization Saraswatia,
        an organization of people very interested in music, art and knowledge. We did not imagine an
        answer to the question whether Saraswatia is a commercial organization, a hobby organization, or both. 
    </p>
    <p>Saraswatia decided to publish an online newspaper about music, art and knowledge. The name will be Sar, which
        is just an abbreviation of `Saraswatia Articles'. 
    </p>
    <p>Marc will add an article about an upcoming multicultural Bazar.
    </p>
