     It is not immediately clear what is meant by the <a href='boolean'>booleans</a> 'indoors?' and 'recurring?'
     Should a happening be considered recurring if such a happening is intended to occur more often or only if it 
     already has occurred at least once? And if so, what if such happenings did occur in the past, but were
     organized by another organization, does that count as 'already occurred'? It is clear that such a
     short caption may leave some questions. However, if you already know what is meant, a short caption 
     is better, as the document looks cleaner and you see the structure in one grasp.
