    <p>
     Make sure you know what the fields in a <a href='../concepts/document_type.html'>document type</a>
     mean.
     Often, this will be clear. Everyone knows what a title or a description is supposed to be.
     There is also no question as to what 'indoors' means.
     But people can answer the question whether a happening is recurring differently.
     A person may consider a happening recurring if it is intended to occur again in the future.
     An other person may consider the same happening as not recurring, because it has not occured
     before.
   </p>
  </div>

   <p>
      The <a href='../concepts/document_type.html'>document types</a> used in your organization, were
      created by an information architect with the
      intent that every <a href='../concepts/contributor.html'>author</a> would
      fill in information with the same meaning of the field in mind.
   </p>
   <p>
      If authors use different meanings of the same field,
      searches and statistics on that field will not be particularly useful.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, as an author, make sure that you know the meanings intended.
    If the information architect chose a name that is unclear, ask for an explanation.
