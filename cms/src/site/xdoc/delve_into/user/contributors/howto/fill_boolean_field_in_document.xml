     <p>
       Two boolean fields, 'Indoors?' and 'Recurring?'. 
       They are in the document 'multibazaar2008', which is of documenttype 'upcoming', but this is not shown. 
       They stand for yes/no questions. The first is if the upcoming happening is indoors. The multicultural bazaar 2008
       which this article is about is not indoors, therefor
       the checkbox is not checked. The second yes/no question is if the upcoming happening is a recurring happening,
       i.e. if such a happening was been organized before. This is true, the same organizors organized multicultural 
       bazaars in the same place with the same intensions before, so that checkbox is checked.
     </p>
   </div>

   <p>
    Open the <a href='./goto_document_tab.html'>document</a> for editing. 
    Below the caption of a boolean field, check the checkbox to answer 'yes'. If you leave the checkbox unchecked, it means
    'no'. Clicking the checkbox checks and unchecks the checkbox alternately.
