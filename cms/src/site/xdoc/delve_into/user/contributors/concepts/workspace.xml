    <p>Workspaces are spaces to do a particular kind of work.
       While working in a workspace, you don't see the other workspaces, so
       you can focus on your work.
    </p>

    <p>
     In the CMS, uses can perform many actions and the CMS can show many types of information.
     There are too many actions possible to fit buttons for all of them in a single window at once and
     there are too many types of information to fit panels for them one on a single window at once.
     It would also not be desirable to fit all in a single window at once, 
     because e.g. <span href='contributor'>contributors</span> are not supposed to do user administration,
     so need not be bothered with buttons and panels for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefor, you see only one workspace at a time, which contains the buttons and panels you need
     for a particular kind of work.
