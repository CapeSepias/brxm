      <p>
       An inputfield is a region in your browser where you are supposed to write something in.
       You do this by putting the mouse pointer in that region and then type characters with your
       keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>Inputfields are generally small boxes, marked with a border and having a lighter background
       than the surroundings, usually white.
       This allows you to easily recognize that you are supposed to type something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, if you are supposed to write al lot in the inputfield, it will be larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may happen that an inputfield has no border and has a background equal to the background
       of the surroundings. Because you are supposed to type something there,
       it is still an inputfield, but it is a badly decorated one.</p>
