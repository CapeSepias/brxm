    <p>
     The content tabulation panel is the panel where the content of the 
     <a href='current_folder.html'>current folder</a> is tabulated.
     The 'name' column of this table gives the names of all items of content 
     while the other columns give more information on each item:
     In the first column an icon indicates the type of the item 
     and in the third column an icon indicates the state of the item:
     if it is published on the web or not.

     <span class='add'>more on publish states</span>
