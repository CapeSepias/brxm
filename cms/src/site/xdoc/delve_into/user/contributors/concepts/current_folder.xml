    <p>
      The current folder 'common' is marked bright yellow in the
      <a href='folder_navigation_panel.html'>folder navigation panel</a> and its contents
      is shown in the <a href='folder_tabulation_panel.html'>folder tabulation panel</a>.
      The current folder contains a document titled 'About Us' and document titled 'homepage'.
     </p>
   </div>

    <p>
     The current folder is one single folder at any time, which is chosen by the user,
     by clicking on its name in the <a href='folder_navigation_panel.html'>folder navigation panel</a>
     or in the <a href='folder_tabulation_panel.html'>content tabulation panel</a>.
     The current folder name is marked with a color in the <a href='folder_navigation_panel.html'>folder navigation panel</a>.
     At any time, the user can chose another folder to be the current folder.
    </p>
    <p>
     The content of the current folder is
     tabulated in the <a href='folder_tabulation_panel.html'>folder tabulation panel</a>.
     The content can be <a href='document.html'>documents</a>, images, assets and subfolders.
     Of all items of content, information is presented in table form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of the subfolders of the current folder are listed under the current folder name in
      the  <a href='folder_navigation_panel.html'>folder navigation panel</a>.
      This allows to proceed to one of the subfolders and make that the current folder.
    </p>
    <p>
     If a <a href='slider.html'>slider</a> folder is the current folder, it is the one that is open.
     If another folder is the current folder, it is marked bright yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that when clicking in a <a href='folder_action_menu.html'>folder action menu</a>,
      that folder has already become current, but the bright yellow marking will only be changed to
      the new folder after the folder action has finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Particular actions are possible for the current folder, such as: creating a document in it,
     creating a subfolder in it, deleting a subfolder from it.
     The actions that a particular user may do on particular folder can be different for different folders.
     The actions that are allowed on the current folder are presented in the
     <a href='folder_action_menu.html'>folder action menu</a>.

      If you are doing the <a href='../tour.html'>tour</a>, use the back button of your browser to continue.
