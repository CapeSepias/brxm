     <span class="shortdesc">How to add a number field to a document type.</span>

  <p>
    In the standard <a href='../concepts/field_type_menu.html'>field type menu</a>,
    of Hippo CMS, there is no number field type to choose.
    But any number is of course also a string, i.e. a sequence of characters,
    so <a href='./add_date_to_documenttype.html'>you can use a date field instead.</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    However, this implies that it is not possible to check if the
    <a href='../concepts/contributor.html'>contributor</a> fills the field with
    a number. He may use any sequence of characters. An organization using Hippo CMS,
    may have the number field added to the field type menu and in the future Hippo CMS
    may have the number field in the standard field type menu.
    <span class='expires'>When Hippo CMS has a number field in the field type menu.</span>
