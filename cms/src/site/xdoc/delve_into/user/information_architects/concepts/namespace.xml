      <span class="shortdesc">What is a namespace?</span>

    <p>In general, a namespace is a named group of names that are mutually unique.
       The same name has exactly one meaning within a namespace,
       but in another namespace it may also occur and may have an other meaning there.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Hippo repository a namespace contains
     <a href='../concepts/documenttype.html'>document types</a> (CMS doctypes).
     Documents and folders in the repository are not part of any namespace.
     However, documents always are of a particular document type and that
     document type is part of some namespace. If you perform the action
     '<a href='../howto/update_content.html'>update all content</a>'
     on a namespace, the contents may change of all documents that are of a document type in that namespace.
    </p>

    <subsection name='Namespace name examples'>

    <subsection name='Namespace name format rules'>
    <p>
       In the Hippo repository, namespace names have the form of a URI (URL) with as last part a version number.
       Namespace names in the form of a URI (URL) are quite common as URI's (and therefor URL's) are supposed to
       be unique in the whole world.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name='full names'>
     <p>
       As namespace names are very long, it would be cumbersome to include the namespace name in each
       name that belongs to the namespace. It should however always be clear to which namespace a name belongs.
       Therefor, a namespace prefix is defined for the namespace, which is short. This namespace prefix is used as
       part of each name in the namespace. A name consists of a namespace prefix, then a colon and then the
       local part of the name. Examples are:
     </p>
       <ul>
        <li>sv:property             The namespace prefix is 'sv'.</li>
        <li>hippo:initializeitem    The namespace prefix is 'hippo'.</li>
        <li>jcr:primaryType         The namespace prefix is 'jcr'</li>
       </ul>
    </subsection>

    <p>
     In the Hippo repository, namespace names have the form of a URI (URL) with as last part a version number.
    </p>
    <p>
       Namespace names in the form of a URI (URL) are quite common as URI's (and therefor URL's) are supposed to
       be unique in the whole world.
       The URL does not have to exist, but if your organization owns a website,
       it is good practice to use an URL your organization owns, as that guarantees it's uniqueness.
   </p>
   <p>
       The version number will be automatically increased by the CMS when
       changes are made to the namespace like making a change to one of its
       <a href='../concepts/documenttype.html'>document types</a> (CMS doctypes).

    <subsection name='More explanation about the concept'>
     <p>Namespaces reflect how people normally talk: context dependent. E.g. if you talk to your spouse about
      'the children', you do not mean the same children as when somebody else talks to his
      or her spouse about 'the children'. The phrase 'the children' refers to different
      children, depending on context. A namespace is such a context. Your family name is a
      namespace.
