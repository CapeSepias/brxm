       A document in review mode.

   <p>
      Review mode for a document type means that a document type is presented to you so that you can
      read it, but not write in it. Review mode prevents you from
      accidentially changing the document type.
   </p>
   <p>
      In review mode, you can also do
      some particular actions with respect to the document that would not be
      useful or appropiate when you are in the middle of changing the document.
      These actions are: requesting scheduling of publication of the document,
      deleting the document and of course: starting to edit the document, i.e.
      going to <a href='./edit_mode.html'>edit mode</a>.

      If you are doing the <a href='../tour.html'>tour</a>, use the back button of your browser to continue.
      (There is no hyperlink here, because you can get here from many different pages.)
