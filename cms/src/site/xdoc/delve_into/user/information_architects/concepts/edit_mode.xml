       A document in edit mode. Saving the document.
    </p>

   <p>
      Edit mode means that a document is presented to you so that you can
      change it, which is inconsistently but generally called '<a href='./editing.html'>editing</a>'.
   </p>
   <p>
      In edit mode, you can also do
      some particular actions to the document that are
      useful and appropiate when you are or have been changing the document.
      Available actions in this version are: save and close and close without saving.
      In both cases you will leave edit mode and go to
      <a href='./review_mode.html'>review mode</a>. In case of save and close,
      you will persist your changes, i.e. create a new version of the document.
      In case of close without saving, you will discard your changes, and things 
      will be as if you never made these changes.
   </p>

      If you are doing the <a href='../tour.html'>tour</a>, use the back button of your browser to continue.
      (There is no hyperlink here, because you can get here from many different pages.)
