      <span class="shortdesc">How to work as a user of Hippo CMS.</span>

       <p>Hippo CMS is designed to allow people to perform their tasks using skills
          actually related to that task. Therefore, the user guide is strictly
          divided into four user roles. Users only require the skills that belong to 
          the role they will perform.
