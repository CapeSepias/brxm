         <span class='shortdesc'>What is a request?</span>

          <p>In Hippo CMS, any request is an act of asking someone to perform an action.
             The most common request in Hippo is to request for a document to be published.
             This is a request from a contributor to an editor. The action that is requested of the editor  
             is reviewing the document and pressing a button
             indicating that the document is to be published. Of course, the editor could also decide to
             deny the request. In Hippo CMS contributors have no button to indicate that a document should
             be published, only that it is ready to be published.
