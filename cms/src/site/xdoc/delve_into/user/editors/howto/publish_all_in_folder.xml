     <span class="shortdesc">How to publish all documents in a folder?</span>

     <p>
      To publish all documents in a folder you select the action from the
      <a href='../../contributors/concepts/folder_action_menu.html'>folder action menu</a> of the
      folder. In the screenshot, the folder action menu of the folder swatia is used, so all documents
      in the folder swatia will be published, which means all documents in the folder tree under the
      folder swatia. Note that at the same time, the folder newspaper is the
      <a href='../../contributors/concepts/current_folder.html'>current folder</a>.
      This does not influence and is not influenced by the publish all documents action.
     </p>
   </div>

   <p>
    A dialog pops up, showing <a href='count_unpublished.html'>how many documents could be published</a>,
    i.e. have an unpublished, saved variant. If you click OK, the publish all in folder action is performed.
   </p>
   <p>A document that is being worked on is not affected by the action.
      Note that this includes not only documents that you are editing, but also
      documents that authors are editing.
      For documents that nobody works on:
      If the document has an unpublished saved variant then that variant is published.
      If it was already published, the published variant overwritten.
   </p>
   <p>
     When the action is completed the dialog shows
     a <a href='count_modified_at_publish.html'>count of how many documents are actually
     modified</a> by the action.
   </p>
