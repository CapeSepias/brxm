                              to decide about publication of documents, images and/or files.</span>

     <p>Janine logs in to Hippo CMS. She has typed her password, but only bullets are shown,
       to prevent someone looking over her shoulder to read it. She chose the Hippo CMS to
       be in English. Now she is about to press the button marked `sign in'.
      </p>
   </div>

        <p>Each time one starts working with Hippo CMS one has to login
           to it, identifying oneself. This ensures that no unauthorized
           persons can get access to Hippo CMS.
        </p>

    <p>
     After <a href='./start_CMS.html'>starting Hippo CMS</a> you will be presented with a login dialog. 
     Type your Hippo CMS username and password.
     These must been
     given to you by your Hippo CMS administrator. That you will
     use Hippo CMS as a editor must have been defined by your
     Hippo CMS administrator.
    </p>
    <p>
     If usernames are not yet defined for your Hippo CMS, then
     you may use the default username and password: username=editor, password=editor.
     Note that in this case, your Hippo CMS is not yet protected by the login procedure,
     as anyone can read this.
