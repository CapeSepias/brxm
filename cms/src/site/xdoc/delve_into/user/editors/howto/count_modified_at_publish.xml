    <section name="Count modified at publish">
     <span class="shortdesc">What does the count of modified documents mean, which is shown after publishing?</span>

   <script type="text/javascript">
    leftpx=0;
    bottompx=500;
   </script>
   <div class='group'>
    <div id='screenshot'><div>
      <img src="../../../../images/screenshots/cms_T07/editors/documents_modified.png" alt='Screenshot of count documents modified'/>
    </div></div>
     <p>
      After the action <a href='publish_all_in_folder.html'>publish all in folder</a>
      is completed, the dialog shows you how many documents are actually modified by the action,
      which means that they are published.
     </p>
     <p>
      Documents that are being edited are not affected by the action.
      Note that this includes not only documents that you are editing, but also
      documents that authors are editing.
    </p>
    <p>In the screenshot the editor Janine is working on the document multibazar2009. This document
     is not affected by the action. This is the only document someone is working on, so
     the count of documents modified is one less than the count of documents to publish.
