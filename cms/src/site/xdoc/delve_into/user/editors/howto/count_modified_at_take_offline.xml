    <section name="Count modified at take offline">
     <span class="shortdesc">What does the count of modified documents mean, which is shown after take offline?</span>

   <script type="text/javascript">
    leftpx=0;
    bottompx=500;

   <div class='group'>
    <div id='screenshot'><div>
      <img src="../../../../images/screenshots/cms_T07/editors/documents_modified_take_offline.png" alt='Screenshot of count documents modified at take offline'/>
    </div></div>
     <p>
      After the action take offline all in folder is completed
      (just like <a href='publish_all_in_folder.html'>publish all in folder</a>)
      the dialog shows you how many documents are actually modified by the action,
      which means that an unpublished variant is created by copying from the published variant.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the screenshot the editor Janine is working on the document multibazar2009. This document
      is not affected by the action. So it is not counted as modified.
      This is the only document someone is working on.
     </p>
     <p>The document panflute was a document with an published and an unpublished variant. So
      the published variant was deleted (as described in
      <a href='take_offline_all_in_folder.html'>take offline all in folder</a>).
      This does not count as a modification of the document.
     </p>
     <p>
      Therefor the count of documents modified is two less than the count of documents to publish.
     </p>
