        <p>
          Hippo CMS offers a fully customizable GUI by means of a frontend plugin architecture.
          Based on <a href="http://wicket.apache.org">Apache Wicket</a>, a component based
          web development framework, this plugin architecture allows for customizations
          ranging from tweaking a particular widget or dialog, to rewriting the entire
          user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section gives background information on how the plugin architecture is
          implemented.
        </p>
