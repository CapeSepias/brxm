    <p>
     In the <a href='export_project.html'>list of projects</a> you can click open
     a project and see the nodes that belong to it. Each item shows a node path
     and the filename it will be exported to. Note that the space between them may come out
     very small. You can exclude a node from the export by selecting 'exclude' in
     the option button of that node.
