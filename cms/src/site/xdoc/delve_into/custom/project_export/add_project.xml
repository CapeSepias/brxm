    <span class="shortdesc">How to add a new project to the list of known projects in the
      project export.</span>

   <p>To add a new project click open the unnamed project. You will see a list of nodes that
     have changed and an input field behind each of them to supply the filename to
     export the node to.
   </p>
   <p>
     Also supply a name for the project. The name is just an identifier specific for the
     project export.
   </p>
   <p>
     If you change the same nodes again, this is considered a change of the project.
     If you change other nodes, they are listed in the new unnamed project.
     Note that you make changes to the repository by using the CMS and by using
     the web console.
