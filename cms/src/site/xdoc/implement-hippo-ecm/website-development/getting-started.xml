      <section name="Quick Start">
 	<p>The quickest way to get started is to obtain one of the pre-built packages. Even when adding additional functionalities to your project, you normally don't need to rebuild Hippo Site Toolkit 2.
	</p>
	<p>
The getting started packages contain all the core packaged components, but have been pre-configured with a number of modules and settings, to give you a quick overview of the HST2 without having the laborious tasks to first enter content, create users, etcetera.
	</p>
      <subsection name="Download">
	<p>
	Two WAR packages are available for download. You can deploy them in either Tomcat or Jetty or any other servlet container that you prefer. 
	Notice: Hippo HST2 has not been released. The following downloads are snapshots of the current build. </p>
        <ul>
         <li><a href="http://repository.hippocms.org/maven2/org/hippoecm/hst/gettingstarted-ecm/1.01.00-SNAPSHOT/gettingstarted-ecm-1.01.00-20080904.141142-1.war">Hippo ECM getting started package WAR</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://repository.hippocms.org/maven2/org/hippoecm/hst/gettingstarted-site/1.01.00-SNAPSHOT/gettingstarted-site-1.01.00-20080904.141142-1.war">Hippo HST2 getting started package WAR</a></li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
<subsection name="Deploy, run and access">

<p>
Below you find how to deploy the application in Tomcat. Once the application has been deployed and started, you
can access the Hippo CMS under the URL:
</p>

  <source>
http://localhost:8080/cms/
  </source>
<p>
The port number may change if you configured you application or servlet
container to run with a different port.  When deploy the application on a
machine other than your local machine you need to change &quot;localhost&quot;
to the correct machine name.
