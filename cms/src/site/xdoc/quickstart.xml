<p>
The quickest way to get started is to obtain one of the pre-built packages.
Even when adding additional functionalities to Hippo ECM, you normally don't
need to rebuild Hippo ECM.  This because more functionality can be added by
simply adding the JARs containing the add-ons to the already packaged product,
or uploading them into the running packaged product. Therefore, there is no
need to do a rebuild from all the sources, one of the two pre-built packages can
always be customized.

The quickstart packages contain all the core packaged products, but have been pre-configured with a number of modules and
settings, to give you a quick overview of the product, without having the
laborious tasks to first enter content, create users, etcetera.

Hippo ECM is a web-based application, and therefor is intended to run inside a servlet or application container.  These containers accept pre-built applications in the form of a WAR or EAR archive package, and provide basic functions to Hippo ECM and management of your application.
To get you started quickly, first determine the platform you wish to use to run Hippo ECM.  Then;
</p>
<subsection name="Download">
<p>
Download either the WAR or EAR package.  For deployment in Tomcat or Jetty,
use the WAR package. The EARs need less configuration and can grow with your needs, 
but require an application container to run in.

Notice: Hippo ECM has not been released.  The following downloads
are snapshots of the current build.
</p>
  <blockquote>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="http://repository.hippocms.org/maven2/org/hippoecm/hippo-ecm-package-war/2.01.00-SNAPSHOT/hippo-ecm-package-war-2.01.00.00000-SNAPSHOT.war">quickstart war package</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://repository.hippocms.org/maven2/org/hippoecm/hippo-ecm-package-ear/2.01.00-SNAPSHOT/hippo-ecm-package-ear-2.01.00.00000-SNAPSHOT.ear">quickstart ear package</a></li>
      </ul>
  </blockquote>

</subsection>
<!-- below commented because not yet documented -->
<!--subsection name="Deploy the application in the container">
<p>
Now follow the guidelines for the platform you are using:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="quickstart-tomcat.html">Deploy WAR in Tomcat</a></li>
  <li><a href="quickstart-jetty.html">Deploy WAR in Jetty</a></li>
  <li><a href="run-hippo-ecm/deploying-the-wars.html">Deploy EAR or WAR in glassfish</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Hippo ECM can also be deployed in other servlet or application containers.  Select the closest resembling container above and
repoduce the steps adapted for your other container if your container is not
listed above.
