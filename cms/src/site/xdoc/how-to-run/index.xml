            At this moment Hippo ECM is still in an early development stage. To run it,
            it is necessary to checkout the sources from the SVN repository, and build
            them using Maven. A full guide can be found under 
            <a href="../extending-hippo-ecm/building/maven.html">Building with Maven</a>.
            The short version below is targeted at those people who know what they are
            doing.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Checkout the sources</h4>
<source>
~/> svn co https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm/trunk hippo-ecm
</source>          

          <h4>Build Hippo ECM</h4>
<source>
~/> cd hippo-ecm
~/hippo-ecm> mvn install
</source>          

          <h4>Run Hippo ECM</h4>
<source>
~/hippo-ecm> $JAVA_HOME/bin/rmiregistry &amp;				
~/hippo-ecm> cd application/reviewed-action/repository
~/hippo-ecm/application/reviewed-action/repository> mvn jetty:run-war
</source>          
          <p>
            And in a different console:
          </p>
<source>
~/hippo-ecm> cd application/reviewed-action/frontend
~/hippo-ecm/application/reviewed-action/frontend> mvn jetty:run-war
</source>          
          <p>
