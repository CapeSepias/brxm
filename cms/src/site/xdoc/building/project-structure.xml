    <section name="Project Structure">
      <p>
        Hippo ECM is a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a> project consisting of
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#How_do_I_build_more_than_one_project_at_once">
        multiple modules</a> which are hierarchically organized as shown below, each module produces exactly one
        artifact (file). Modules come in four flavors, depending on the type of artifact they create.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>JAR</b> projects create a jar file that can be used in applications.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>WAR</b> projects create a web application (a war file) that can be deployed
            in a servlet server (tomcat, jetty etc.).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>EAR</b> projects create an enterprise application (an ear file) that can be deployed
            in an application server (glassfish, weblogic etc.).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>POM</b> projects act as 'glue' for binding together other projects,
            they don't create anything themselves
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The figure below shows the project layout. Every node in the directory tree
        constitutes a Maven project of one of these three types.
        The <a href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates">artifactId</a>
        matches the project directory layout.

    <section name="Why so many projects?">
      <p>
        The large number of projects is a direct consequence of the fact that Hippo ECM
        has been designed from the ground up for customizability and extendability as described in the
        <a href="../extend-hippo-ecm/plugins/index.html">plugin</a> documentation. The repository and frontend
        engines that make up the core of Hippo ECM don't implement much functionality themselves. All 'userland'
        functionality is implemented by plugins that are loaded by the engines. See the chapter on
        <a href="../run-hippo-ecm/repository-bootstrap.html">Bootstrapping the repository</a> for
        further information about this subject.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Addon">
      <p> Plugins are bundled in so called addons which are simple Jar projects under the 'addon'
        directory. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>cms</b> is a bundling of all frontend addons that together make up the main
          functional blocks of the default CMS. Each tab (perspective) in the CMS user interface has
          it's own addon.</li>

        <li><b>defaultcontent</b> is a repository addon containing some simple sample content meant
          for demonstration purposes</li>

        <li><b>reporting</b> is a bundling of a repository addon and a frontend addon which together
          implement reporting functionality for the CMS. Usage examples of this addon are the
          activity and todo views on the cms-dashboard</li>

        <li><b>reviewed-action</b> is a <a href="../about-hippo-ecm/architecture.html#Workflow API">
          workflow</a> addon, it implements all business and GUI logic around document lifecycle:
          reviewing, (un)publishing etc. It is a bundling of three addons and a test project: a repository
          addon implementing the business logic, a frontend addon bundling some frontend plugins for user
          interaction and a common addon for the interface between the two. </li>

        <li><b>builtin</b> is also a workflow
          addon, it differs from other workflow addons in the fact that the server-side
          implementation is implemented by the repository engine itself instead of in a separate Jar
          like with a normal addon. Note that these builtin workflow steps are very generic and
          low-level and should not be accessed directly. They should only be called indirectly from
          other workflow plugins as part of a chain of workflow steps.</li>

        <li><b>standards-frontend</b> contains a collection of shared frontend plugins. For
          instance, all cms-* addons contain a Perspective plugin (BrowsePerspective,
          EditPerspective, ...), so it makes sense to have a common baseclass in standards-frontend.</li>

        <li><b>template</b> is a frontend addon that implements the document template editor</li>

        <li><b>versioning</b> is a frontend addon that contains plugins for interacting with
          document versioning implemented by the repository</li>

        <li><b>xinha and xinha-frontend</b> are frontend addons that together make up the Xinha HTML
          editor.</li>

        <li><b>yui</b> is a frontend addon implementing Drag&amp;Drop functionality and other
          javascript magic.</li>
      </ul>
      <subsection name="Dependencies between addons">
        <p> Because addons are ordinary java projects built with Maven it is extremely easy to add
          any inter-addon Java dependency that may seem nessessary. If left unchecked this can easily
          lead to a situation where all addons depend on each other. When this happens the whole idea of
          splitting functionality between addons becomes obsolete and we might as well put all
          plugins into one big addon, or better yet into the engines themselves and reduce the
          number of projects drastically. Obviously this will also kill all customizability and
          extendability. <br/><br/> On the other hand completely forbidding all inter-addon
          dependencies goes to far because it prohibits code reuse. A middle way is to keep these
          dependencies to a minimum and stick to some simple guidelines: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Repository addons should NEVER directly depend on each other via a Java dependency.
            Even in the case of one workflow calling another this is not done by a direct Java call,
            but via 'workflow chaining' which is core repository functionality.</li>

          <li>As a general rule a dependency 'via the repository' is preferred (by far) over a
            direct Java dependency. Examples of this kind of dependency are the displaying of
            Xinha editors by the template editor and the use of the reporting addon by the
            cms dashboard.</li>

          <li>If there's no other way frontend addons MAY directly depend on each other: Examples are
            the yui-frontend addon that contains wicket behaviours that perform all kinds of javascript
            magic that many application plugins would very much like to use, and the standards-frontend addon
            which acts as a parking place for oftenly used, shared frontend code that doesn't really belong
            in the frontend engine itself.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> To make a long story short: Currently there are very few Java dependencies between addons
          and we're planning to keep it that way. </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Finding your way">
        <p>
          In order to help you find your way some simple naming conventions
          are used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The maven artifactId matches the project directory layout</li>
          <li>Wicket frontend classes in frontend plugin addon-foo-bar are in package org.hippoecm.frontend.plugins.foo.bar</li>
        </ul>
