                <p>
                    A typical application that interfaces with Hippo Repository most likely 
                    has an architecture like the one depicted above. The application consists 
                    of a custom software component and a JCR api for communicating in a standarized way with
                    Hippo Repository. This makes it extremely simple to write an application that operates on the 
                    content repository. All you have to know is where to get a repository instance and
                    how to manipulate a JCR tree, which has a very self explanatory interface. You'll be
                    suprised by the simplicity of programming against Hippo Repository, while at the same time 
                    taking advantage (with no extra effort) of the powerfull features build into Hippo Repository like 
                    faceted search.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following section presents a demo application, demostrating all stated above.

            <subsection name="What's the demo all about">
                <p>
                    In the demo you will walk recusively through a 
                    arbitrary directory on the file system, extract some meta-data and store the file
                    accordingly in Hippo Repsitory, then subsequently apply a faceted search on the stored data.

            <subsection name="Give me the code!">
                <p>
                    <!--The code as shown below is actually nothing special, it does not deviate in any way from a standard application
                    communicating with a JCR complient implementation. The Dropbox class recursively walks through a given 
                    directory and tries to detect the file-type through the Java Activation Framework. 
                    The DropboxExt, as the class name indicates is a extension on the Dropbox. 
                    It adds a DocType property to a file which should contain a more understandable meaning
                    of what the file is for non-tech users. Later on in this demo we will use the DocType 
                    property to construct a faceted search.-->

                The code is available from the SVN repository:

                <p>
                First checkout the source code from the svn repository and 
                <a href="../extend-hippo-ecm/building/maven.html">build it using  Maven 2</a>.
                </p>
<source>
svn co https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm/trunk hippo-ecm
cd hippo-ecm/
mvn clean install
</source>

                <p>
                Start Hippo Repository:
                </p>
<source>
cd hippo-ecm/application/default/repository
mvn jetty:run-war
</source>
                <p>
                Open up <a href="http://localhost:8081/repository">http://localhost:8081/repository</a> to check 
                if everthing is working.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Start the user interface for browsing the repository:
                </p>
<source>
cd hippo-ecm/application/default/frontend
mvn jetty:run-war
</source>
                <p>
                Open up <a href="http://localhost:8082">http://localhost:8082</a> to check 
                if everthing is working.
                <br/> 
                (tip: the location is displayed in the last lines of the shell output) 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Now that we have everything up and running we need to configure the demo's pom.xml located in the root
                of the project. Open pom.xml and look for the arguments tag. <br/>
                argument 1: the location of your repository<br/>
                argument 2: the location of your dropbox<br/>
                argument 3: the username for logging into the repository<br/>
                argument 4: and the password 
                <br/><br/>
                
                Everything configured? Let's start the demo.
                </p>
<source>
cd hipp-ecm/tools/dropbox
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java
</source>
                
                <p>
                If everything went well the output should look something like this:<br/><br/>
                <img src="../images/dropbox-running.jpg" alt=""/>
                <br/><br/>
                All content from your dropbox folder is now stored in Hippo Repository. You can explore
                the contents through the provided user interface. 
                </p>

            <subsection name="Applying Hippo Facets">
                Prerequisite: <a href="../use-hippo-ecm/facets/index.html">knowlegde of facets</a>
                <br/>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Using the user interfave, select the root node.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a new node with a name of your choice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Select this node and add the following properties, hippo:docbase -> dropbox, hippo:facets -> 
                  (multi-value) DocType.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then again select the previously constructed node and the result should look like something as depicted below. <br/>

              <p>
                Congratulations! You just ran a custom application interfacing with the Hippo ECM Repository and
                applyed a facet search on the stored data!
