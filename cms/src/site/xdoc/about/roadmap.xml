         <span class='shortdesc'>What's up for the future?</span>
	 <p>
	   <a href="http://www.onehippo.com">Hippo</a> develops features for customers that have a <a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/support">Hippo Support License</a>. Our wishlist below contains all the features that we'd like to have one day, and for some we've already implemented parts in the architectural foundations. If you think Hippo CMS is a good match for your situation, but you require any of the features on our wishlist (or something that is *not* on our list :) ), contact <a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/support">Hippo Support</a> directly. Of course, code donations for any of the features on our wishlist are very very welcome!
	 </p>
         <p>
           This is a list of how we intent to roll out functionalities, even though some changes may occur as priorities shift.
           The version numbers follow <a href='./version_numbers.html'>the Hippo version numbering scheme</a>.
           Note that only the supported releases are listed here, not the beta versions, monthly updates or Release Candidates. See the
           <a href='http://www.onehippo.org/about/release_schedule.html'>notes on the release schedule</a> for
           more information.

	    <h3>The Wishlist</h3>
For all of the items on the wishlist we're sure it should be possible to build them into Hippo CMS given its broad architectural foundations. We simply have not yet had the change or the need to implement them. For some we already have a partial implementation, but it requires a little extra effort to turn them into reusable components.
