        The Hippo CMS (Content Management System) is the webbased graphical userinterface to the content in the 
        repository of the Hippo ECM. It provides an easy way to create and manage your content, i.e. to 
        write or upload, share, print, search, refer to, edit and structure content, asign rights to do so, 
        have content automatically validated against your business rules and restore previous versions of the content. 
      </p>

          Companies that use Hippo CMS, design their own content structure. Hippo CMS ensures that all content  
          fits into this single structure. Thus, the content base of the company will be filled with information 
          actually useful to the company; required information will actually be there 
          and the content base will be easily understandable and searchable, thanks to its uniformity.
