        Hippo CMS (Hippo Content Management System) is the web-based graphical user interface to the content in the
        repository of Hippo ECM. It provides an easy way to create and manage your content, i.e. to
        write or upload, share, print, search, refer to, edit and structure content, assign rights to do so,
        have content automatically validated against your business rules and restore previous versions of the content.
      </p>
      <p>Hippo CMS is open source and continually in agile development, providing new features monthly.
         See the <a href='./changes-report.html'>release notes</a> for available releases and the
         <a href='./about/roadmap.html'>roadmap</a> for coming releases.

          Organizations that use Hippo CMS, design their own content structure. Hippo CMS ensures that all content  
          fits into this single structure. Thus, the content base of the organization will be filled with information 
          actually useful to the company; required information will actually be there 
          and the content base will be easily understandable and searchable, thanks to its uniformity.
