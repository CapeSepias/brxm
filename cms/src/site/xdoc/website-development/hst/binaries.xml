      <section name="Serving binaries with the BinariesServlet">
        <p>
          The HST contains a servlet for serving binaries, e.g. a gif image or a pdf document.
          The servlet should be installed in your web.xml, 
          see <a href="configuration.html#BinariesServlet">configuration</a>.
        </p>
        
        <subsection name="How does it work?">
          <p>
             All data in Hippo Repository is stored as property of a certain node. 
             The BinariesServlet will look for a node in the repository based on the url it gets.
             If the application uses the <a href="url-mapping.html">URL mapping</a>functionality,
             it will transform the incoming url to a path in the repository, if not it will just use 
             the incoming url directly as repository path. Then, the repository node found by the servlet
            should have the following two properties: <code>jcr:mimeType</code> and <code>jcr:data</code>.
          </p>
          <p>If above node and properties are found, the servlet will</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set the found mime type to the response</li>
            <li>Write the property as stream to the response</li>
          </ul>
        </subsection>
        <subsection name="Usage">
            <p>It is common use to access the BinariesServlet in the <code>src</code> attribute of
              a <code>img</code> tag, or in the <code>href</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> tag.</p>
            <p>The path to the binary node in the repository should be easily obtained using the
              expression language's <code>_path</code> property (<a href="el-index.html#FixedProperties">see here</a>). 
              In the following example <code>hippo:small_image</code> is a subnode of the current context:</p>

  <c:if test="${context['hippo:small_image'] != null}">
      <img src="/<contextpath>/binaries${context['hippo:small_image']._path}"/>
  </c:if>]]></source>
