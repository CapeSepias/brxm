          made available for download. It is in fact the currently running
          <a href="http://www.onehippo.com" target="_blank">onehippo.com</a> website.
          To run it, you also need a combined CMS 7 / Repository 2
          with initial content in it. </p>

        <subsection name="Download and run Repository 2 / CMS 7.">
          <h4>Download</h4>
          <p>Download the <a href="/onehippo-ecm.war">onehippo.com ECM as a war</a>.</p>
          <h4>Run</h4>

        <subsection name="Download and run the HST site.">
          <h4>Download</h4>
          <p>Download the <a href="/onehippo-site.war">onehippo.com site as war</a>.</p>
          <h4>Running</h4>
          <p>Deploy the war in your favorite web server. The current distribution assumes that
            some components are provided </p>
          <h4>Running on Tomcat</h4>
          <p>If you are running the site in Tomcat, make sure the following components
            are available in the Tomcat installation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>javax.transaction</strong>: Tomcat out-of-the-box lacks javax.transaction
              package, however the HST depends on it. The package may be installed for example
              in Tomcats <code>shared/lib</code> directory. An example of such a package is
              Genronimo's <code>geronimo-spec-jta-1.0.1B-rc2.jar</code>, which may be obtained under
              through the <a href="http://geronimo.apache.org">Apache Geronimo project</a> as with Maven 2 groupID <code>geronimo-spec</code>
              and artifactId <code>geronimo-spec-jta</code></li>
            <li><strong>Standard core and formatting taglibs</strong>: the example site uses
              two standard taglibs, core (<code>c:</code>) and formatting (<code>fmt:</code>).
              These taglibs should be provided by the container and may be obtained
              through hte <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/"> Apache Jakarta project</a>.
              Version should be 1.1.2 or higher.</li>
