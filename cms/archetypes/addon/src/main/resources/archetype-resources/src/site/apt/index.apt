Hippo OEM Add-on Archetype

  The Add-on archetype allows you to generate a template project to develop front-end
plugins for the Hippo OEM.

  To create a project, execute the following maven command:

+--
mvn -DartifactId=your-artifactid -DgroupId=your-groupid -DarchetypeArtifactId=hippo-ecm-archetype-addon -DarchetypeGroupId=org.hippoecm -DarchetypeVersion=2.02.00-SNAPSHOT archetype:create
+--

  Replace your-artifactid and your-groupid by the artifact and group to be used in your project,
and your project is created.
