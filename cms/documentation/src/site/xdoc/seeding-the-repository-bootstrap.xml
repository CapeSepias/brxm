The Hippo repository has been designed to allow for extensive customization.
In such a degree even, that the bare repository has only limited
functionality.  Two examples; for one, it defines no template document
structure.  What constitutes a document is dependent on the application domain
and is normally configured seperately.  Workflow, which defines which
operations are allowed on documents, is a pure plugin.  The repository only
defines how a workflow can be accessed, not which operations it can define or
which implementation to be used.

Because of this high pluggable structure, the bare repository is relatively
lean, and you are likely to always need to add, replace, or remove modules in
your own environment, to obtain the set of functionalities you require.  The
default repository you can download comes with a number of modules available
to it.

A big problem with many systems, is that customization requires rebuilding the
application to include the additional features.  With Hippo repository it is
possible to add new functionalities to an existing databases without
rebuilding the application.

running repository add new functionality by uploading 

Note: at this time, the repository will only load the new features at start-up
time.  It is therefore required that you stop and restart the repository
server.  In addition
