        <h1>Hippo ECM facets</h1>
        <p>
          The Hippo Repository is build on top of
          <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/" alt="Apache Jackrabbit">Apache Jackrabbit</a>.
          The Hippo Repository adds extra functionality to the default Jackrabbit distribution while
          keeping full compliance with the JCR 1.0
          <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr170/index.html" alt="JSR 170">JSR 170</a>.
          The main added features are facets, virtual nodes and workflow.

            [FIXME Frank: ripped from Arje's blog]
            By (not) organizing the hierarchy of the content repository upfront, but by allowing
            it to grow dynamically based on meta data, I hope we can adhere to David Neuscheler's
            Rule #1, which was inspired by Stefano's "Data first vs Structure first" blogposting.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the core of Hippo Repository 2, there is a faceted representation of physical
            folders in Jackrabbit.  Those virtual trees are again exposed as 'normal' JCR nodes, and
            can be used to represent all kinds of data in all kinds of different structures purely
            defined by their meta information.
          </p>

            <subsection name="Defining the facets">
              <p>
                Facets are defined by nodes of type <code>hippo:facetsearch</code>.  These nodes will
                form the root of the virtual folder structure.  They have the following JCR properties:
              </p>
                  <dt>hippo:queryname</dt>
                  <dd>This property contains the name of the query.  It is used to ...</dd>
                  <dt>hippo:docbase</dt>
                  <dd>
                    The base physical (?) folder whose contents will be used to generate the
                    virtual folder
                  </dd>
                  <dt>hippo:facets</dt>
                  <dd>
                    This multivalued property contains the names of the properties that will be 
                    comprise the virtual folder structure.
                  </dd>
