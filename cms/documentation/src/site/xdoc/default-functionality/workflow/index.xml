          Customisability of Hippo ECM is achieved by means of a configurable plugin framework.
          All standard functionality is implemented as plugins, which can be extended and customised.
          New plugins can be written to add functionality. New functionality will typically be 
          implemented as an add-on, consisting of a number of plugins.

          <p>
            Plugins can be divided into two groups: repository plugins and frontend plugins.
            An add-on can consist of only repository plugins, or only frontend plugins, or both,
            depending on the kind of functionality implemented.
