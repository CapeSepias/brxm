              <p>
                The <b>Document Wizard</b> is an addon for Hippo CMS that lets CMS users create
                new documents quickly and easily from the dashboard. On clicking a shortcut link a dialog window opens
                where information for the document to create can be entered. On clicking OK the new document is
                created in the right folder. This way the user does not have to navigate to the folder in the documents section.
              </p>
            <p>
              In the current version two ways of determining the folder name are offered. By giving a date, the document is
              created in a folder structure following the /yyyy/mm format. E.g. if the date is December 16, 2010, the document
              is created in the folder /2010/12.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other way to determine the folder name is to pick the name from a list. The values of the list come from a ValueList
              created by the <a href="http://forge.onehippo.org/gf/project/selection/">Selections Plugin</a>.
