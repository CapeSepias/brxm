        <h2>Plugin examples</h2>
        <p>
            This is a Plugin Panel. A Plugin Panel is a Panel that implements the 
            method "void update(AjaxRequestTarget target, JcrNodeModel model)". Through that
            interface it receives update events from other plugins (like the tree or the menu) when it
            needs to refresh it's content with a new Model.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example plugin could grow into a plugin central.

            <h3>Context aware dialog</h3>
            <div wicket:id="plugin-dialog"/>
            A 'context-aware' dialog is a dialog whose implementation
            (java+markup) can be determined at runtime. To see this in action: select a(ny) node,
            add a Property with name 'renderer' and as value the classname of a(ny) subclass of AbstractDialog   
            (like org.hippocms.repository.plugins.admin.menu.move.MoveDialog).
            Select the Node again and click on this <a wicket:id="plugin-dialog-link">link</a>.           
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>renderer</b>                    
                    <fieldset>
                        <span wicket:id="renderer"></span>
                    </fieldset>
                    <br/>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <span wicket:id="exception"></span>
        </p>
    </wicket:panel>
