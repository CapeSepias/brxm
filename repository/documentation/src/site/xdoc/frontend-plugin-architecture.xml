    <h1>Frontend Plugin Architecture</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hippo ECM provides an <a href="http://wicket.apache.org">Apache Wicket</a> based
      plugin architecture to facilitate a customisable GUI. All standard GUI components are written
      as plugins. The Hippo CMS application offers a default configuration for these plugins.
      Customising Hippo CMS comes down to extending the standards plugins, and/or writing your own,
      and configuring them to form your own custom application.
