                    The Hippo Repository has three main layers as illustrated with the diagram above. 
                    The yellow layer represents the persistence layer, consisting of a database and a 
                    lucene index. This is where all the actual data is stored. The blue layer represents 
                    the main engine. The blue layer is where all the logic is done. The green layer is the 
                    API layer. All applications that are connected to the Hippo Repository use these APIs to 
                    communicate with the Hippo Repository.

                <p>
                    Hippo Facet Engine works out of the box, and does not need any configuration to start with. 
                    Browsing through faceted navigation gives you a virtual structured view with counting on your (unstructured)
                    physical data. 
                    The facet engine works through intelligent indexing in <a href="#Lucene">Apache Lucene</a>, and is extremely
                    fast, as if you are browsing through a (fast cached) File System. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Facet Engine can be configured if fast faceted browsing on some indirect value, like the week number of
                    a date, is needed. See <a href="../configuration_files/searchindex.html">Search Index</a> at the bottom.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Databases">
                The database is used to store the actual content. A wide range of databases is supported, 
                such as: MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL, Derby and PostgreSQL. 
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="Lucene">
                <p>
                    Content and meta data is indexed through implementation of <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">Apache Lucene 2.2.0</a> search engine library.
                    It is a scalable, high-performance indexing, accurate and efficient search algorithm cross-platform Open Source application, with a strong
                    prospering community. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the possible searches through Lucene that are enabled are listed below
