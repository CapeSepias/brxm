                    Hippo Facet Navigation works out of the box. Browsing through authorized faceted navigation gives you multiple ordered views 
                    with the number of occurences on your (unstructured) physical data. One single document can be found via multiple
                    faceted paths. Users do not have to think about structuring the content in a hierarchical of taxonomic order, but
                    rather the structure evolves organically based on meta data and the users' authorisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                   The Hippo Facet Navigation works extremely fast for a faceted view with counting and authorization. The view
                   renders as if you are clicking through a cached File System. 
                   <br/>
                   Hippo Facet Navigation includes user based faceted authorisation which makes it very
                   powerful as a DMS, where instead of users having to worry about structure, they browse 
                   to their specific content the way they want.
