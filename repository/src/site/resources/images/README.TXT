The folder screenshots/ contains the subfolders of screenshots of different versions. Before M9 the screenshots were not placed in the screenshots folder, but in inars/ contribs/ editors/ and admins directly in this images folder. They should be removed, butthis was not done yet, to prevent possibly breaking links.
