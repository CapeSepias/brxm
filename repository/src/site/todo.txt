- Building Hippo ECM [WG]
	- Create "Building Hippo ECM" page
	- Project structure [WG]
	- Building with Maven
	- Building with Eclipse
		It would be useful to separate the work into
		1) setup eclipse plugins
		2) setup a freshly checked out tree
		3) update projects after a (pom) update
		The most common case is the last one (3), which is very straightforward. It should be obvious that, once a developer has jumped through hoops (1) and (2), the work to maintain a configuration is minimal.
