      <subsection name="Install Maven">
        <p>
          Hippo ECM is built using Maven 2 (version 2.0.6 or newer). Follow the 
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html"> Maven installation instructions</a>.
        </p>
          
        <div style="border:1px solid black; padding:1em;">
          <p>
            <b>For Windows users</b>
            <br/>
            You need to take care that your local Maven 2 repository is not located in a folder with
            spaces in the pathname. The default Maven installation procedure will locate
            it in your home directory which on Windows is a subdirectory of the
            "Documents and Settings" directory.  This means that you need to relocate your local Maven repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create and edit the file
            <b>c:\Documents and Settings\&lt;Your Name&gt;\.m2\settings.xml</b> with the following content:
          </p>
<source>
<![CDATA[
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <localRepository>C:\\mvnhome</localRepository>
</settings>
]]>
</source>
          <p>
            This effectively relocates your local Maven repository to <b>c:\mvnhome</b>.
          </p>                 
        </div>
      
      </subsection>
          
      <subsection name="Get the Hippo ECM source">
        <p>
          The source can be found at <a href="https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm">https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm</a>
          and can be anonymously checked out using any <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> client.
          Instructions on Subversion use can be found at <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>.
          The following command checks out the trunk to a directory called 'hippo-ecm'
        </p>
          <source>
~/> svn co https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm/trunk hippo-ecm
          </source>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Build">
        <p>
          Assuming that you have checked out the Hippo ECM source in the directory
          ~/hippo-ecm
        </p>
        <source>
~/> cd hippo-ecm
~/hippo-ecm> mvn install
        </source>
        <p>
          This will take a while and put all project artifacts (jars, wars) in your local maven repository
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Run">
        <p>
          The preferred way of running Hippo ECM is by <a href="../../run-hippo-ecm/deploying-the-wars.html">
          deploying the application wars in an application server</a>.
        </p>
        <p>  
          To facilitate development it is also possible to run Hippo ECM from the commandline using Jetty,
          this needs some preparation:
        </p>
        <p>
          Start the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/rmiregistry.html">rmiregistry</a>
          This is a small program that is shipped with the JDK, it can be found in $JAVA_HOME/bin
        </p>
        <p>
          For Windows: ,          
        </p>
        <source>
C:> %JAVA_HOME%\bin\rmiregistry.exe
        </source>
        <p>
          For Unix:                  
        </p>
        <source>
~/hippo-ecm> $JAVA_HOME/bin/rmiregistry &amp;        
        </source>
        <p>  
          To start a sample application from the command line, execute the following commands:
        </p>
        <source>
~/hippo-ecm> cd application/reviewed-action/repository
~/hippo-ecm/application/reviewed-action/repository> mvn jetty:run-war
        </source>
        <p>
          This will start a repository server. 
          Open a browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:8081/repository">http://localhost:8081/repository</a>
          to view its contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another console execute the following commands:
        </p>
        <source>
~/hippo-ecm> cd application/reviewed-action/frontend
~/hippo-ecm/application/reviewed-action/frontend> mvn jetty:run-war
        </source>        
        <p>
          This will start the content browser.
          Open a web browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:8082">http://localhost:8082</a> 
          to navigate and edit your repository.
        </p>
