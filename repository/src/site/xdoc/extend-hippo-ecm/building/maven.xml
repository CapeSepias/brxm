    <section name="Building with Maven">

      <subsection name="Install Maven">
        <p>
          Hippo ECM is built using Maven 2 (version 2.0.6 or newer). Follow the
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Maven installation instructions</a>.
        </p>

        <div style="border:1px solid black; padding:1em;">
          <p>
            <b>For Windows users</b>
            <br/>
            You need to take care that your local Maven 2 repository is not located in a folder with
            spaces in the pathname. The default Maven installation procedure will locate
            it in your home directory which on Windows is a subdirectory of the
            "Documents and Settings" directory.  This means that you need to relocate your local Maven repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create and edit the file
            <b>c:\Documents and Settings\&lt;Your Name&gt;\.m2\settings.xml</b> with the following content:
          </p>
<source>
<![CDATA[
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <localRepository>C:\\mvnhome</localRepository>
</settings>
]]>
</source>
          <p>
            This effectively relocates your local Maven repository to <b>c:\mvnhome</b>.
          </p>
        </div>

      <subsection name="Get the Hippo ECM source">
        <p>
          The source can be found at <a href="https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm">https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm</a>
          and can be anonymously checked out using any <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> client.
          Instructions on Subversion use can be found at <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>.
          The following command checks out the trunk to a directory called 'hippo-ecm'
        </p>
          <source>
~/> svn co https://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-ecm/trunk hippo-ecm
          </source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Build">
        <p>
          Assuming that you have checked out the Hippo ECM source in the
          directory <code>~/hippo-ecm</code>.  If you want to build the Hippo
          ECM packages you should run the command:
        </p>
        <source>
~/> cd hippo-ecm
~/hippo-ecm> mvn package
        </source>
        <p>
          This will build the packages and leave them in the target
          directories of your maven build.  For instance the produced EAR
          containing all the applications is available in
          <code>hippo-ecm/package/ear/target/hippo-ecm-package-ear-2.01.00-dev.ear</code>.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Run">
        <p>
          The preferred way of running Hippo ECM is by <a href="../../run-hippo-ecm/deploying-the-wars.html">
          deploying the application wars in an application server</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To facilitate development it is also possible to run Hippo ECM from the commandline using Jetty.
          To start a sample application from the command line, execute the following commands:
        </p>
        <source>
~/> cd hippo-ecm
~/hippo-ecm> mvn install
~/hippo-ecm> cd package/war
~/hippo-ecm/package/war> mvn clean jetty:run-war
        </source>
        <p>
          The <code>mvn install</code> is required to put all project artifacts (jars, wars) in your local
          maven repository, as required by the maven-jetty-plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open a web browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>
          to navigate and edit your repository.
        </p>
