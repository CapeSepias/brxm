        <section name="Version numbering scheme">
         <span class='shortdesc'>How are Hippo ECM versions numbered?</span> 

            <p> The version numbering works as follows.<br/> Example: Hippo CMS v7.1, r2.05.02<br/>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Version part</th>
                            <th>Definition</th>
                            <th>Occurancy</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v<b>7</b></td>
                        <td>Hippo CMS <b>architecture</b> number <b>7</b></td>
                        <td>Every several years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v7.<b>1</b></td>
                        <td>The 7.1 <b>release</b> of Hippo CMS, architecture 7</td>
                        <td>Four times a year</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v7.1, r<b>2</b></td>
                        <td>Shipping with <b>Hippo Repository version</b> 2</td>
                        <td>Every several years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v7.1, r2.<b>05</b></td>
                        <td>The 5th <b>sprint iteration</b>, preparing for release v7.1</td>
                        <td>Monthly</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>v7.1, r2.05.<b>02</b></td>
                        <td>The 2nd <b>Release Candidate</b>, at the end of sprint 5, <br/>which
                            resulted in release v7.1</td>
                        <td>Several per month</td>
                    </tr>
                </table> In this example, the codebase that the internally used versionnumber
                (r2.05.02) refers to was tagged as the supported Hippo CMS <b>release</b> v7.1. </p>

            <p>The reason that we have two distinct version numbers (v7.x and r2.x) is that the
                first one (v7) refers to the Hippo CMS release, and the second one (r2) to the Hippo
                Repository release. Since Hippo CMS 7 was build after (and wraps) Hippo Repository
                2, the version numbering that is often referred to in developers documentation and
                conversations is Hippo Repository v2.xx.xx. This is also the basis of our Jira
                project name (<a href="http://issues.onehippo.org/browse/HREPTWO">HREPTWO</a>), which
                refers to Hippo Repository 2. </p>
            <p> Starting from December 19th, 2008, after the release of Hippo CMS v7.0, our leading
                version number is the Hippo CMS release number (v7.x). Since Hippo Repository is
                frequently used as a headless repository without a CMS user interface, the
                repository version number is still in use to indicate changes in the Hippo
                Repository codebase. </p>
