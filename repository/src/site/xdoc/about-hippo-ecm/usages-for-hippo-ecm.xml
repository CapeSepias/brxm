            <p>Hippo ECM can be used in a wide variety of cases, and can be tailored where needed.
                Hippo does not enforce structure, although it does bring clarity in the enormous
                amount of content that users have to cope with on a day to day basis. Some of the
                most common usages are listed in this section. </p>

        <section name="Using Hippo ECM for Document Management">
            <p>Out of the box, Hippo ECM provides Document Management functionalities that allows
                users to share and collaborate on documents. Hippo ECM extends standard Document
                Management functionalities by allowing users to organize all information in a way
                that is most useful to themselves or to the group they participate in, without
                forcing anyone to use a certain predefined structure.</p>
            <p> By using the Hippo ECM Faceted interface, anyone can start adding documents in no
                time without having to worry about the structure in which information should be
                stored. </p>
