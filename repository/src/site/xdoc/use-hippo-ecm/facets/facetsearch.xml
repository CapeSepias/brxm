        Hippo Repository is built on top of
        <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/" title="Apache Jackrabbit">Apache Jackrabbit</a>.
        Hippo Repository adds extra functionality to the default Jackrabbit distribution while
        keeping full compliance with JCR 1.0
        <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr170/index.html" title="JSR 170">JSR 170</a>.
        The main added features are virtual nodes based on facets (metadata), access management, authorization and workflow.

    <section name="Faceted navigation">
      <p>
        Faceted navigation allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object,
        enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways, rather than a single,
        pre-determined order. This means objects can be navigated to along different
        paths, each based on different classifications or properties of those objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hippo Repository supports a faceted representation of physical
        nodes. These representations are again exposed as 'normal' JCR nodes, and
        can be used to represent all kinds of data in all kinds of different structures purely
        defined by their meta information. This results in virtual node trees
        providing a faceted navigation.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Defining the facets">
        <p>
          Facets are defined by nodes of type <code>hippo:facetsearch</code>.  These nodes will
          form the root of the virtual folder structure.  They have the following JCR properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>hippo:queryname</b>
            <br/>
            The name of the query. You can choose any name you like.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>hippo:docbase</b>
            <br/>
            The base physical folder whose contents will be used to generate the
            virtual folder
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>hippo:facets</b>
            <br/>
            This multivalued property contains the names of the properties that will be
            comprise the virtual folder structure.
          </li>
        </ul>
