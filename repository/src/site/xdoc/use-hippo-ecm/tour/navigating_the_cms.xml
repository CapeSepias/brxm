              <p>
                  The CMS user interface is navigatable by clicking on the tabs in the top of the UI. 
                  Some of these tabs are static, like Dashboard, Browse and Management, which means they will
                  always be visible (if the user has the appropiate rights of course) and cannot be closed by the user.
                  <img src="../../../images/tour/nav1.jpg" alt="Dashboard tab selected"/><br/>
                  <em>Listing 1: Dashboard tab selected</em>
                  <br/>
                  <img src="../../../images/tour/nav2.jpg" alt="Browse tab selected"/>
                  <em>Listing 2: Browse tab selected</em>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>                  
                  Other tabs, like a document being edited, are dynamic which means they will only load if the user triggers
                  an action (like 'Edit document') and can be closed again. This gives users the freedom to edit more than one document at a time.
                  <img src="../../../images/tour/nav3.jpg" alt="Document 'myarticle' selected"/><br/>
                  <em>Listing 3: Document 'myarticle' is being edited</em>
                  <br/>
                  <img src="../../../images/tour/nav4.jpg" alt="Document 'yourArticle' selected"/><br/>
                  <em>Listing 4: Document 'myarticle' and 'yourArticle' are being edited, 'yourArticle' tab currently in focus</em>
                  <br/>
                  
              </p>

          <section name="Navigating the repository">
              By selectting the Browse tab, user are presented with a basic file browser interface 
              consisting of three panes.<br/>
              The left pane displays a tree-view on the repository, showing only 'folder' like nodes. Upon selecting a 'folder' in the tree, the middle pane 
              will display all 'folders' and hippo:handles that belong to the selected 'folder' in a sortable list.<br/>
              By selecting a node in either the left or middle pane results in a list of actions that can be executed upon that node, in the right pane.
