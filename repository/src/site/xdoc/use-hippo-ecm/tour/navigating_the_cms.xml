    <section name="Navigating the CMS">
      <p>
Hippo CMS7 has a tabbed user interface. These tabs allow the user to switch 
between different perspectives that all have their own state. Some actions, 
like for example clicking on a document link in the dashboard perspective, 
will automatically open up the browse perspective and highlight the 
corresponding document in its current location.<br/>
      </p>
      <subsection name="Static perspectives">
Some perspectives are static, like the dashboard (listing 1) or the browse 
(listing 2) perspective, which means they will always be visible (assuming 
the user has the appropiate rights) and cannot be closed. 
      </subsection>

        <em>Listing 1: Dashboard tab selected</em>
        <br/><br/>
        <img src="../../../images/tour/nav2.png" alt="Browse tab selected"/><br/>
        <em>Listing 2: Browse tab selected</em>
      </p>
      <subsection name="Dynamic perspectives">
Other perspectives, like the document editor, are dynamic which means they 
are created on-the-fly and can be closed again. This gives users the freedom
to have multiple documents open simultaneously (listing 3). 
      </subsection>
      <p>
        <img src="../../../images/tour/nav4.jpg" alt="Document 'yourArticle' selected"/><br/>
        <em>Listing 3: Document 'myarticle' and 'yourArticle' are being edited, 
            'yourArticle' is currently in focus</em>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Navigating the repository">
      <p>
By selectting the Browse tab, the user is presented with a basic file 
browser interface consisting of three panes.<br/>
The left pane displays a tree-view on the repository, showing the folders 
the user is allowed to see. Upon clicking a folder in the tree-view,   
all folders and documents that belong to the selected folder will be 
displayed as a sortable/pageable list in the middle pane.<br/>
      </p>
      <subsection name="Actions">
Documents and folders all have a list of (workflow)actions that can be 
executed upon them. These actions are displayed in the right pane and 
will be (re)loaded every time a user clicks on a document or folder 
in either the left or middle pane.
