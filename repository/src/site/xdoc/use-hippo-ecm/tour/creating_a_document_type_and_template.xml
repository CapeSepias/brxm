    <section name="Creating a document type and template">

      <p>
        It is possible to create your own document types.  Using the workflow
        steps that are used, we'll create one.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Create a Namespace">
        <p>
          Select the Browse tab and navigate to "document types".  Click the
          "create namespace" link and enter a prefix and a URL.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/tour/create-namespace.png" alt="create namespace" />
        <p>
          The URL defines a globally unique address.  It is not resolved, i.e.
          it is not necessary that opening the link in a browser will show
          anything.  The best practice is to pick a domain under your control.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Create a new Type">
        <p>
          Select the example namespace and follow the "Create new type" link.
          Enter a name for the type that you're about to create.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/tour/create-type.png" alt="create type" />
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Edit Model">
        <p>
          It is now possible to customize the type.  Select the newly created
          type and click "edit model" under the Actions.  Initially no fields
          are present, but you can add those in the editor.
          <ul>
            <li>Click "String" to add a string property to the document model</li>
            <li>Click the edit icon next to the String field that appears</li>
            <li>Change the path to "example:title"</li>
            <li>Change the Caption to "Title"</li>
            <li>Press "save"</li>
            <li>Click "Html" and the edit icon</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/tour/edit-model.png" alt="edit model" />
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Update Content">
        <p>
          The edited model can not be used yet.  At the moment it is only known
          to the CMS, but no node type has actually been defined yet.  So it is
          not yet possible to create new documents of this type.  Bear with me,
          you'll soon be able to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Save the model and go back to the Browse tab.  Select the namespace
          that you created (say, "example").  There is an "Update content" link
          under the list of available actions.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/tour/update-content.png" alt="edit model" />
        <p>
          You're now able to create folders that can contain the new type.
        </p>
