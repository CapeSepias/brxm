                To edit a document, users must first locate and select it using the Browse tab. A list of actions 
                will then be displayed in the Actions pane and if the user has the appropiate rights this list will contain
                an action called 'Edit'.

                <br/><br/>
                Clicking on the 'Edit' action will instantiate a new Editing-tab and open the document in our document Editor.
