      <section name="Using Hippo ECM">

        <p>
          Hippo ECM provides a number of functionalities "out of the box". This section
          describes how to make use of those functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hippo Repository is built on top of
          <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/" title="Apache Jackrabbit">Apache Jackrabbit</a>.
          Hippo Repository adds extra functionality to the default Jackrabbit distribution while
          keeping full compliance with JCR 1.0
          <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr170/index.html" title="JSR 170">JSR 170</a>.
          The main added features are virtual nodes based on facets (metadata), access management, authorization and workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining facet selects and facet searches gives you an enormeous flexibility in exposing your 
          data in endless possible ways. Every user could have her own desirable view of the data, obviously
          automatically combined with their access rules!
        </p>

            - Browse your content through multiple navigation paths based
            on meta information

            <a href="facets/facetselect.html">Facet select</a>
