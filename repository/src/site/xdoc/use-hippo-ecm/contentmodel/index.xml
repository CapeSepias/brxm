              <p>
              For large repositories, you do not want the users to have to think about where to 
              place a document. You do not want them to have to think about the structure of the folders. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  Instead, you want to let structures come into existance based on content modelling, where
                  you can expose multiple (virtual) structures based on the possibly unstructured underlying data.
                  
              </p>
              <p>
                  These structures can be exposed through queries, facetsearches and facetselects. 
              </p>
