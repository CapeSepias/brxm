              <p> 
                  Currently, any jcr browser can navigate through Hippo Repository. A WebDAV 
                  compatible view will be added.
              </p>

              <subsection name="Search Query GUI in CMS">
              <p> 
                  Creating searches won't need XPATH or SQL skills, but will be created through
                  a CMS GUI in which you click together some search criteria, including preview of
                  the results. 
              </p>
