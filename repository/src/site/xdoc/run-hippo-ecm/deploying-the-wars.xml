                No special settings are needed for the default wars. The default configuration can 
                be adjusted and overridden by adjusting the

                Currently there are no pre-built WARs available and a

                    <li>hippo-ecm-application-reviewed-action-frontend.war</li>
                </ol>
                Now you can browse to the following urls:
