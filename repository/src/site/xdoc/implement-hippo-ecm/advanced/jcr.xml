          <p>
            Hippo Repository provides a standard Java Content Repository (JCR) interface that is also known
            as <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170" target="_blank">Java Specification Request 170</a>.
            It uses an <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr-api.html" target="_blank">Apache JackRabbit</a> implementation.
          </p>

        <subsection name="JCR Basics">
          <p>
            A Java client that wants to use the interface must retrieve a <code>javax.jcr.Session</code> object.
            A static factory class is available to help with that. A simple example on how to connect and login
            to a Hippo Repository based on location, user name and password is:
          </p>
<source>
<![CDATA[
HippoRepository repository
      = HippoRepositoryFactory.getHippoRepository("rmi://localhost:1099/hipporepository");
  javax.jcr.Session session = repository.login(<userName>, <password>);
  session.getRootNode()  etc..
]]>
</source>
          <p>
            For a less trivial example see the <a href="jcr-dropbox-example.html">Dropbox Demo</a>.
            It shows how to import content into the repository, and how to work with metadata
            and facets, all through the JCR interface.
