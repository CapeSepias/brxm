        <p>
          While Hippo ECM can be used out of the box to manage your content, implementing
          the system in your unique environment will require some work. This section describes
          how to publish your content on your own website, as well as more advanced possibilities such
          as managing your technical documentation and manuals, or gaining low level access to
          your content through the JCR interface.
