        <p>
          Using the <a href="../../../user/information_architects/howto/document_types/editor.html">Document Type Editor</a>, you can create
          straightforward document types. The most commonly used field types are
          available <a href="../../../user/information_architects/howto/document_types/fieldtypes.html">out of the box</a>. In most cases, these
          will satisfy your requirements. However, if you cannot achieve
          what you want using the graphical editor, there is always the option of
          defining your own custom field types at JCR level.
