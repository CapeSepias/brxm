        This particular diagram is not to stay here in this way. 
        This is a <span class='index' title='index'>information exchange diagram</span> (just invented by me), that shows 
        some of the processes occuring with Hippo ECM and the information exchange between them.
        Processes with direct information exchange between them (arrows), occur simultaneously.
        Contrary to data flow diagrams, information exchange diagrams only show that information
        is exchanged between two processes and in what direction(s), but not which and not in what 
        order, as that is too much detail.
        I intend to use information exchange diagrams often, as I think they give important 
        information in a clear way.

                Configuration of Hippo CMS is often as simple as 
                adding the path to your companies data base server. Without this path, Hippo CMS will use
                a folder on your filesystem to store the content.

                If a quickstart package was installed, configuration for actual use requires two
                settings that ensure that the example content is not used and not recreated on your data base server.
