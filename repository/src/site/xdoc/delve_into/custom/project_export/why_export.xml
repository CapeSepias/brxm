    <span class="shortdesc">Why customized content in sources?
    </span>

  <p>
     For experienced developers this is trivial,
     but let's explain this for beginners and anyone else interested.
  </p>
  <p>
   A single developer could work with the same repository all
   through development and all his customized content will
   be kept in this repository. In almost all other cases the
   customized content has to be exported and included
   in the sources.
   E.g. when developers work together they will have to share
   customized content via svn.
   Furthermore, when a project is be packaged,
   e.g. to go in production or for a demo,
   the customized content has to be in the sources.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you copy a project to another machine,
   you could also copy the repository.
   This is especially convenient if it is a derby repository,
   i.e. on your filesystem. But if you want to use another
   database to keep your repository, it is especially convenient
   to use a database independent format like XML as intermediate.
   Although XML takes a lot of disk space because it has a lot of
   overhead, in compressed form it is quite small, because the
   large redundancy in the overhead makes it very compressible.
