    <span class="shortdesc">How to export customized content </span>

  <p>
   The Project Export is a functionality for developers.
   It allows to conveniently export any customized content
   from the repository. This includes configurations,
   namespaces (with document types, aka backend templates) and
   document trees.
   Such exports of customized content are necessary
   in order to include the customized content to the sources
   of a project.
   They are imported automatically when initializing
   a fresh content repository.
   Doing the exports by hand is quite tedious. The
   Project Export functionality is more convenient.
