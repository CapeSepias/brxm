      <span class="shortdesc">Modify the dashboard layout to give your GUI plugin a permanent place.</span>
      <p>
        Now instead of replacing an existing plugin it would be nice if our plugin 
        had it's own pace on the dashboard. For this we have to edit the file 
        <b>/package/layout/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/layouts/default/org/hippoecm/frontend/plugins/cms/dashboard/DashboardPerspective.html</b>.
        Here we add the following code at the location we want to render our plugin.

        FIXME: Build package-layout after modifying it

      </source>
      
      <subsection name="Adding you plugin to the repository">
        <p>
          First we need to create a node for our plugin. To do this navigate (in the console) to 
          <b>/hippo:configuration/hippo:frontend/cms/cms-static</b>. Make sure you have the "cms-static" 
          node selected. 
          Now add a node called "helloWorldPlugin" and give the primary type "frontend:plugin". 
          Add two properties to the new node. One called "plugin.class" with the value of your 
          plugin (org.example.helloworld.HelloWorldPlugin)
          and a second one called "wicket.id" with the value "service.helloworld".
          Now the plugin is added to the repository and it is time for the dashboard to find it 
          (Don't forget to save your changes).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our plugin is in the repository but the dashboard doesn't know that, so time to
          update the dashboard. Using the console, navigate to 
          <b>hippo:configuration/hippo:frontend/cms/cms-static/dashboardPerspective</b>. Under wicket.extensions 
          you will see the current plugins shown on the dashboard. Add an entry "extension.helloworld".
          Next add a property called "extension.helloworld" and give it the value "service.helloworld".
          Now the dashboard knows where to find the plugin that is referenced by extension.helloworld 
          (again, don't forget to save your changes).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if you log in to the CMS the HelloWorldPlugin should show up on the dashboard.
        </p>
