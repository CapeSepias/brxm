        <p>
         Assets (binary documents, i.e. .pdf and images) are stored as a single packet, so
         are the first to not fit in the database.
        <a name='increase_packet_size'/>
         Increase the <span class='index' id='max_allowed_packet'>max_allowed_packet</span> variable of your database server to allow 
         for larger assets. Be aware that this will reduce <a href='./performance_tuning.html'>performance</a>.
