      <span class='shortdesc'>How to download a file into a folder renamed to some name?</span>
    
       <p>                 
         This just means that you should get your system to a state in which a copy of the file on the website
         exists in the specified folder on your system under the specified name.
       </p>
       <p>
         So if in some action list you are for example asked to `download the Hippo CMS WAR
         to the $TOMCATDIR/webapps/ folder renamed to cms.war', then you should make sure that there is a copy 
         of that Hippo CMS WAR in the $TOMCATDIR/webapps/ folder on your system and that copy should have the name
         cms.war before you continue with any next step of that action list.
       </p>
       <p>
         So you may download the required file from the website under its origional name and afterward rename it, or
         you may supply the new name before downloading. If you just click on the link, your browser will probably not
         give you the opportunity to supply a new name before downloading, but if you open a menu on the link and choose
         in the menu 'save link as' or something similar, you can supply a new name before downloading.
