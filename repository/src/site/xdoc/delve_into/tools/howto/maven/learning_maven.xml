      <li>
       Maven commands always works on the current directory, so you have to cd to
       the directory you want Maven to work on.
      </li>
      <li>
       Maven commands will only work on directories
       containing a <code>pom.xml</code> file, which defines a maven project.
      </li>
      <li>A project may contain subprojects, of which the root directory contains its
       own <code>pom.xml</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you have no time for the tests or the tests themselves are broken, the
       tests can be skipped with <code>-DskipTests</code>:
       <source>mvn -DskipTests clean install</source>
       Although the older flag <code>-Dmaven.test.skip</code>
       still works,
       the documentation of the maven plugin explicitely advices NOT to use it, 
       as maven.test.skip will change the build procedure.
       Different artifacts are the result.
