        <p>
          Publishing dynamic content on the web is the most common use case for Hippo CMS.
          To integrate Hippo CMS in your new or existing web site, intranet or
          extranet, you can use the high level tools provided by Hippo.          
        </p>

            Using one of the available toolkits is the recommended way to 
            develop websites for publishing 
            Hippo CMS managed content. 
            The toolkits help you create websites and portals using the
            technology of your choice.

    <p>
     If you need even more extra functionality to use with your website, 
     the toolkits and/or the Hippo CMS can be extended by plugin 
     developers. The extra functionality then becomes available for
     the webdevelopmers in a transparent way.
