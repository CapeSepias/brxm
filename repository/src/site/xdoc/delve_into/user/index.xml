   <section name="User Guide">
    <span class="shortdesc">How to work as a user of Hippo CMS.</span>

    <p>Hippo CMS allows to define which role(s) a user may perform.
       In day to day usage,
       <a href="./contributors/index.html">authors</a>
       write and add content,
       and <a href="./editors/index.html">editors</a>
       decide about publishing
       the content.
       The authors write documents that each are of a certain
       <a href="./contributors/concepts/document_type.html">document type</a>.
       The document type specifies what kind of information the document should provide.
       The document types are a kind of business rules and are
       composed by <a href="./information_architects/index.html">information architects</a>,
       generally before any meaningful documents
       are written.
       All users, authors, editors and information architects have to
       get an account from a
       <a href="./cms_admins/index.html">CMS administrator</a>.
       Unlike the other users, CMS administrators
       have no part in the content of the CMS, they only assign permissions.
    </p>

<p>
  For documentation for specific roles, see the table.
  For a more general introduction on the use of the Hippo CMS, see below the table.

<subsection name='General introduction for users of the Hippo CMS'>
<p>
The use of document types guarantees that different documents are similar and this allows
fast development of any application that
makes use of the documents. For example, a web developer need only to know about a few document
types to make a website for hundreds of thousands of documents. He need not know about
the documents themselves. Users of the Hippo CMS need not know about making websites, just about
what kind of information should be provided.
