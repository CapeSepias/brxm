    <section name="Count published documents">
     <span class="shortdesc">How to get a count of all published documents in a folder?</span>

   <script type="text/javascript">
    leftpx=0;

   <div class='group'>
    <div id='screenshot'><div>
      <img src="../../../../images/screenshots/cms_T07/editors/documents_to_take_offline.png" alt='Screenshot of count published documents'/>
    </div></div>
     <p>
      After you perform the action take offline all in folder
      (just like <a href='publish_all_in_folder.html'>publish all in folder</a>)
      a count is presented of all documents in the folder tree that are currently published.
     </p>
     <p>In the <a href='../../contributors/concepts/folder_tabulation_panel.html'>folder tabulation panel</a>
        in the screenshot the state icons show that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>The document artificial intelligence is currently published,
          so this document is counted.</li>
         <li>The document panflute is currently published,
          so it is counted. A newer variant exists,
           but that makes no difference.</li>
      <li>The document multibazaar2009 is currently published, so it is counted.
          The document is being edited, but that makes no difference.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Click cancel if you do not actually want documents to be taken offline.
