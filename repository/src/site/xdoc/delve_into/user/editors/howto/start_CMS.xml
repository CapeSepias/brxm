     Starting the Hippo CMS site of the organisation Swatia.
     The web address of that Hippo CMS site happens to be: http://cms.swatia.org/.
     The site is not yet visible, because the user has not clicked yet.
     Coincidentially, the site currently visible happens
     to be the Hippo CMS documentation site at <a href='http://www.onehippo.org'>www.onehippo.org</a>.
    </p>
   </div>

   <p>
      The Hippo CMS is accessed via your web browser.
      Someone, e.g. your CMS administrator, must have told you the web address of the site.
      For the Swatia CMS site, the name is http://cms.swatia.org/.
      If nobody told you the name, replacing 'swatia' by the name of your company is a good guess.
      And additionally replacing 'org' by 'com' is also a good guess. But any name is possible.
   </p>
   <p>
      In the special case that the Hippo CMS server program runs on your own computer, the web
      addresss of the Hippo CMS site will be:
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/cms/">http://localhost:8080/cms/</a>. Note that this
      link will only work in that special case.
