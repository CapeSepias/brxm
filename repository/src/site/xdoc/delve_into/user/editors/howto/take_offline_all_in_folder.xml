     <span class="shortdesc">How to take offline all documents in a folder?</span>

     <p>
      To take offline all documents in a folder you select the action from the
      <a href='../../contributors/concepts/folder_action_menu.html'>folder action menu</a> of the
      folder. This goes the same as
      <a href='publish_all_in_folder.html'>publish all in folder</a>.
    </p>

   <p>
    A dialog pops up, showing <a href='count_published.html'>how many documents could be taken offline</a>,
    i.e. are published. If you click OK, the take offline all in folder action is performed.
   </p>
   <p>A document that is being worked on is not affected by the action.
      Note that this includes not only documents that you are editing, but also
      documents that authors are editing.
      For documents that nobody works on:
      If the document is published and has no unpublished variant then the published variant is kept as unpublished
      variant.
      If the document is published and also has an unpublished variant the published variant is deleted.
   </p>

   <p>
     When the action is completed the dialog shows
     a <a href='count_modified_at_take_offline.html'>count of how many documents are actually
     modified</a> by the action.
     Documents of which the published variant are deleted are not counted as being modified.
     Documents of which the published variant is kept as unpublished variant are counted as being modified.
   </p>

   <p>Note that if you take offline documents you may cause broken links.
     This will occur if published documents refer to one of the documents being taken offline.
     If you take a single document offline you will be warned about existing
     <a href='referring_documents.html'>referring documents</a>, but not when you take offline all documents
     in a folder.
     For one document at a time you
     can <a href='../../contributors/howto/show_referring_documents.html'>list all referring documents</a>.
