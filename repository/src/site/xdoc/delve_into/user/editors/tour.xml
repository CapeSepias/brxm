  <section name="Hippo CMS Editor Tour">
    <span class='shortdesc'>To get introduced to the role of CMS Editor, take the following tour.</span> 

     <p>To get introduced to the role of CMS editor, you will look over the shoulder of
        Janine, who works for the imaginary organization Saraswatia,
        an organization of people very interested in music, art and knowledge. We did not imagine an
        answer to the question whether Saraswatia is a commercial organization, a hobby organization, or both. 
    </p>
    <p>Saraswatia decided to publish an online newspaper about music, art and knowledge. The name will be Sar, which
        is just an abbreviation of `Saraswatia Articles'. 
    </p>
    <p>Janine will for example decide if articles written by contributors can be published in
       the Sar newspaper.
    </p>
