         <span class='shortdesc'>What about scheduling the online publication of documents?</span>

          <p>Scheduled publication is a feature of Hippo CMS
             involving scheduling the online publication of documents.
          </p>
          <p>
             If an <a href='./editor.html'>editor</a>
             wants to publish a document online, or take a published
             document offline, he or she will be asked when this
             action has to be taken by the system.
          </p>
          <p>The feature of scheduled publication gives more freedom
             to the editor than unscheduled publication, which entails
             that publication actions can only occur immediately after
             the editor set the appropiate marks.
          </p>
