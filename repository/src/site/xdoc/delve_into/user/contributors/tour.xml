  <section name="Hippo CMS Contributor Tour">
    <span class='shortdesc'>To get introduced to the role of CMS Contributor, take the following tour.</span> 

     <p>To get introduced to the role of CMS contributor, you will look over the shoulder of
        Marc, who is a member of the imaginary organization Saraswatia,
        an organization of people very interested in music, art and knowledge. We did not imagine an
        answer to the question whether Saraswatia is a commercial organization, a hobby organization, or both. 
    </p>
    <p>Saraswatia decided to publish an online newspaper about music, art and knowledge. The name will be Sar, which
        is just an abbreviation of `Saraswatia Articles'. 
    </p>
    <p>Marc will add an article about an upcoming multicultural Bazaar.
    </p>

       Marc received a username and
       password from his CMS administrator, to login to the CMS,
       i.e. to get access to the CMS. 
       <br/>  
        To login to the CMS,
        Marc types his username and password in the appropiate inputfields. 
        His password is only known to him, so you do not get to see it.

         For the article about the upcoming multicultural bazaar, Marc creates a
         document named 'multibazar2009'. He selects for it the document type 'upcoming',
         because that is the type for upcoming happenings, like the bazaar.

         indoors. Marc knows that the bazaar is not indoors and he adds that information
         in the document.
         He also is supposed to answer the question whether the happening is
         a recurring happening, i.e. a happening that has occurred before. 
         This is the case, so Marc also adds that information to the document.

         writes an informative text about the upcoming multicultural bazaar.
         He includes the place where the bazaar will be in this description,
         because there is no separate field for it and people need to know.
