     <p>
      About to discard the changes in the draft version of the document
      'multibazaar2009', by pressing the kill <a href='../concepts/tab_page.html'>tab page</a>
      cross on the tab of the tab page. If there are outstanding changes in your draft version,
      a popup will ask if you want to save or discard them.
     </p>
   </div>

   <p>
      After <a href='../concepts/editing.html'>editing</a> a document
      (e.g. <a href='fill_markuped_text_in_document.html'>writing marked-up text</a>),
      you may not like what you wrote so you may want to discard your changes, reverting
      to a previous version.
      As mentioned above, this is possible via the
      the kill <a href='../concepts/tab_page.html'>tab page</a>
      cross. Note that it is possible to discard the changes in your draft version,
      but not the changes in your preview version.
      As <a href='save_document.html'>save</a> writes to the preview version,
      each time you save, you are persisting you last changes, i.e. you
      can not discard them any more.
