    <span class="shortdesc">Why and how to learn the meaning of an inputfield?</span>

   <script type="text/javascript">
    leftpx=450;
    bottompx=480;
   </script>
   <div class='group'> 
    <div id='screenshot'><div>
     <img src="../../../../images/screenshots/cms_M9/contribs/fill_boolean_field.png" alt='Fill boolean screenshot'/> 
    </div></div> 
   <p>
      Consider as example the inputfield 'recurring?'.
      This is a <a href='boolean'>boolean</a>, i.e. a yes/no question, and the caption
      is 'recurring?'. So the question is whether the happening (that is what the document is about)
      is recurring or not.
      However, it is not immediately clear what exactly 'recurring' is supposed to mean.
      Should a happening be considered recurring if such a happening 
      is intended to occur more often or only if it 
      already has occurred at least once? And if so, what if such happenings did occur in the past, but were
      organized by another organization, does that count as 'already occurred'? It is clear that such a
      short caption may leave some questions. However, if you already know what is meant, a short caption 
      is better, as the document looks cleaner and you see the structure in one grasp.
   </p>
  </div>

   <p>
      The <a href='../concepts/document_type.html'>document types</a> used in your organization, were
      created by an information architect with the 
      intent that every <a href='contributor'>contributor</a> would
      fill in information that answers exactly the same questions. 
      We will call information that answers exactly the same question: similar information.
   </p>
   <p>   
      Ensuring that information is similar allows to use all similar information at once. 
      It would for example be possible
      to select all happenings that are recurring, or give statistics on how many of the happenings 
      are recurring or if there are more recurring happenings this year than last year.
   </p>
   <p>
      However, if not every contributor answered exactly the same question when he filled in the
      'recurring?' inputfield, then the information is not really similar and a selection of all
      happenings that are recurring could almost be a random selection, not usefull.
      Likewise, the statistics will be meaningless numbers.
   </p>
   <p>
      So, as a contributor, you have the responsibility to ensure that you answer all the questions
      in a <a href='../concepts/document_type.html'>document type</a> as they are intended.
