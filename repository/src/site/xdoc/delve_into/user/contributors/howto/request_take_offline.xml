    <p>
      About to request to take off line the document 'multibazaar2009'.
    </p>
   </div>

   <p>
    When you have a published document and you want it taken offline,
    go to the <a href='../concepts/review_mode.html'>review mode</a> of the document and
    select the 'take offline (request)' action at the top.
    The editor will receive your request and if he accepts your request, the document will
    be taken offline.
   </p>
   <p>You can not change a document after you did a request for it for publication or taking
     offline: your document actions menu will not show any action for it.
     As soon as the editor handled your request, you can change the document again.
   </p>

   <p>
     If you just request taking the document offline it will be done as soon as the
     editor accepts your request. You may want it postponed to some particular moment.
     Then request scheduling it. A scheduling window will popup just as when
     <a href='./schedule_publication.html'>scheduling a publication</a>.
   </p>

   <p>Note that the editor can publish or take offline documents without your request.
      See <a href='./editor_actions.html'>editor actions</a>.
