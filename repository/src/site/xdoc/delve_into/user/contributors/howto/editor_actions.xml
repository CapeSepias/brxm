    <p>In the history list in your <a href='../concepts/home_workspace.html'>home workspace</a>
       you can find out about editor actions.
    </p>
   </div>

    <p>
     When you make a request then your editor (a person) can accept or reject your request or
     withdraw your request as part of another action.
     Your editor can publish or take offline your documents without your request. He
     or she can do this with a single action on all documents in a folder tree.
    </p>

   <subsection name='History'>

    <p>The meaning of the history list shown in the screenshot is explained below.
      The order of the items in the CMS is newest first.
      The order of the items below is reversed.
    </p>

<ol>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine published "Arini McLean"</p>
  <p>The editor Janine published the document "Arini McLean" without a request for it.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, marc requested publication for "multibazar2009"</p>
  <p>The author Marc requested publication of the document "multibazar2009".
     The appropriate editor will receive this request. This is Janine.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine accepted the request for "multibazar2009"</p>
  <p>The editor Janine accepted publication of the document "multibazar2009".</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, marc requested "multibazar2009" to be taken offline</p>
  <p>The author Marc requested the document "multibazar2009" to be taken offline.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine published "panflute"</p>
  <p>Independent of Marc's request, janine publishes the document "panflute".
     You can not see this in the list, but this is part of publishing all of
     the newspaper folder, which contains "panflute", "artificial intelligence"
     and "multibazar2009". The latter was already published. This action of Janine
     has no influence on the request of Marc.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine published "artificial intelligence"</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine took "panflute" offline</p>
  <p>Independent of Marc's request, Janine takes document "panflute" offline now.
     You can not see this in the list, but this is part of taking offline all of
     the newspaper folder, which contains "panflute", "artificial intelligence"
     and "multibazar2009".</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine took "artificial intelligence" offline</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine withdrew request for "multibazar2009".</p>
  <p>As part of Janine's action, Janine withdraws Marcs request. This occurs automatically.
     She may never have noticed Marcs request.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>Half an hour ago, janine took "multibazar2009" offline</p>
  <p>As part of Janine's action, Janine takes the document "multibazar2009" offline.
     So she does what Marc requested, but independent of Marc's request.</p>
 </li>
 <li>Half an hour ago, marc logged in
 </li>
 <li>Five minutes ago, marc requested publication for "multibazar2009"
 </li>
 <li>Five minutes ago, janine rejected request for "multibazar2009".
 </li>
 <li><p>One minute ago, marc withdrew request for "multibazar2009"</p>
  <p>After Janine requested Marc's request, Janine does not see the request any more,
     but Marc sees his request on the document, until he withdraws it.</p>
 </li>
 <li><p>One minute ago, marc requested publication for "multibazar2009"</p>
    <p>Notice that Marc also sees his request in his todo list.</p>
 </li>

   <p>Edits of editors and other authors are also visible in your history list.</p>

   <subsection name='What happens to your documents when the editor ...'>

   <p>
    When you request publication of a document, you can not change the document until
    the editor handled your request.
    The situation is different when the editor publishes your document without your request.
    Likewise for taking offline.
   </p>

   <p>
    If you are changing the document while the document is being published or taken offline,
    nothing happens: the document is unaffected.
   </p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name='Publishing'>
    <p>Assume the editor is publishing your document and you are not working in it.</p>
    <p>If an unpublished saved variant of your document exists it is published. If a published
       variant already existed then that one is overwritten.
    </p>
   </subsection>

   <subsection name='Taking offline'>
    <p>Assume the editor is taking offline your document and you are not working in it.</p>
    <p>
     Where the published variant of the document goes depends on
     what you did after it was published.
     If you did not do anything to the document after it was published,
     the published variant will be kept as unpublished variant.
     So if you start to change the document, you start out with the content that was formerly
     published.
    </p>
    <p>If you have changed the document and saved your changes, the published variant
       is deleted. Your unpublished changed variant is kept unpublished.
      </p>
