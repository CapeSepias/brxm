      <p>You see here a screenshot of Hippo CMS. You can try out the following instructions 
         on this screenshot.
      </p>
   </div>

    <p> 
         The screenshots in this userguide
         normally only show a small part of the screen, the part that is relevant for the
	 text. 
    </p>
    <p>
	 Sometimes, you may want to see the rest of the screenshot, if you do not recognize
	 where that part is in the total screen. You can see the complete screenshot:
	 place the mouse pointer on the screenshot. The image will then become as
	 large as possibly fits on your page and if not all fits, you can use 
         the scrollbars with your mouse pointer to scroll over the screenshot.
	 If you click on the screenshot, it becomes small again, showing the relevant part.
	 In the small state, you also can use the scrollbar, as long as you only touch the
	 scrollbars, not the image.
    </p>
