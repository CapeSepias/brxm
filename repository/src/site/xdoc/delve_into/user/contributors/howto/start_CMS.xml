      Marc goes to the Hippo CMS site of Saraswatia. His CMS administrator told him
      that the web address of the site is: http://saraswatia.org:8080/cms.
      Coincidentially, the site he is currently viewing happens 
      to be the Hippo CMS documentation site at www.onehippo.org.
    </p>     
   </div>

   <p>
      The Hippo CMS is accessed via your web browser.
      Someone, e.g. your CMS administrator must have told you the web address of the site. 
      For the saraswatia CMS site, the name is http://saraswatia.org:8080/cms.     
      In most other cases, only 'saraswatia.org' will be replaced by some other name.
      <span class='rewrite'>Check what are normal names and make new screenshot.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
      In the special case that the Hippo CMS server program runs on your own computer, the web 
      addresss of the Hippo CMS site will be:
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/cms/">http://localhost:8080/cms/</a>. Note that this
      link will only work in that special case.
