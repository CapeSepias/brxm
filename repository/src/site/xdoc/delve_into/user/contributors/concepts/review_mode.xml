    <p>
       The document named 'hahaha' in review mode.
       The document has the meaningless body 'sdfsdf' and the author Marc is
       about to request deleting this document.

      Review mode means that a document is presented to you so that you can
      read it, but not write in it. Review mode prevents you from
      accidentally changing the document.
   </p>
   <p>
      In review mode, you can also do
      some particular actions with respect to the document that would not be
      useful or appropriate when you are in the middle of changing the document.
      At the top, next to the <a href='edit_mode.html'>Edit</a> button,
      you see buttons for several action menus.
      These action menus are:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>Publication actions:
      <a href='../howto/request_publication.html'>request publication</a>,
      <a href='../howto/request_take_offline.html'>request take offline</a>,
      <a href='../howto/schedule_publication.html'>schedule publication or take offline</a>.</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous: request deleting the document.</li>
    <li><a href='document_actions_menu.html'>Document actions</a>:
      <a href='../howto/show_referring_documents.html'>Show referring documents.</a></li>
   </ol>
