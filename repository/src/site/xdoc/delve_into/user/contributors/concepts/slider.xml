      The sliders in the <a href='./folder_navigation_panel.html'>folder navigation panel</a>.
      The 'images' slider is now open, while the 'documents' slider above it is closed,
      and the 'assets' slider below it is also closed.

    <p>
     Sliders are a way to present information, without showing everything at once.
     In a set of <i>sliders</i>, only one slider is fully visible at any time, while of all other sliders
     only the caption, with its name, is visible.
     Sliders slide up and down and always keep their order.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the <a href='./folder_navigation_panel.html'>folder navigation panel</a>,
       the items organized in sliders are the upperlevel folders, folders that have no parent folders.
       As they are folders, they will become the <a href='current_folder.html'>current folder</a>
       if their slider is selected, while no subfolder within that slider is selected.
