      About to press the newspaper folder in the
      Documents <a href='slider.html'>slider</a> in the folder navigation panel.
      Before pressing,
      the <a href='current_folder.html'>current folder</a> is the common folder. 
      After pressing, it will be the newspaper folder.

    <p>
     The folder navigation panel is the panel in
     the <a href='content_workspace.html'>content workspace</a> where you can
     navigate in the folder tree, to go to a particular folder, which will become the
     <a href='current_folder.html'>current folder</a>.
     The upper level folders are navigated by <a href='slider.html'>sliders</a>,
     while all lower level folders are navigated in a tree.
    </p>

      If you are doing the <a href='../tour.html'>tour</a>, use the back button of your browser to continue.
      (There is no hyperlink here, because you can get here from many different pages.)
