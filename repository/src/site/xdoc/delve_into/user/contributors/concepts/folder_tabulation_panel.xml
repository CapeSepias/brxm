      About to click the document 'multibazar2009' in the folder tabulation panel.
      This document is one of the two documents in folder 'newspaper', which
      is the <a href='current_folder.html'>current folder</a>, being selected in the
      <a href='folder_navigation_panel.html'>folder navigation panel</a>.
      <!-- Note that the left part of the content tabulation panel
       will be hidden under the
       <a href='documents_panel.html'>documents_panel</a>, if any document is .........
      -->

    </div>

    <p>
     The folder tabulation panel is the panel where the content of the
     <a href='current_folder.html'>current folder</a> is tabulated.
     The 'name' column of this table gives the names of all items of content
     while the other columns give more information on each item:
     In the first column an icon indicates the type of the item
     and in the third column an icon indicates the state of the item:
     if it is published on the web or not.

     <span class='add'>more on publish states</span>

      If you are doing the <a href='../tour.html'>tour</a>, use the back button of your browser to continue.
      (There is no hyperlink here, because you can get here from many different pages.)
