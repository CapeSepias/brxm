      An example of a workspace: the <a href='./content_workspace.html'>content workspace</a>.

   <p>
       Workspaces are spaces to do a particular kind of work.
       While working in a workspace, you don't see the other workspaces, so
       you can focus on your work.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the CMS, users can perform many actions and the CMS can show many types of information.
       There are too many actions possible to fit buttons for all of them in a single window and
       there are too many types of information to fit panels for them on a single window.
    </p>
    <p>
       It would also not be desirable to fit all in a single window (at once), 
       because e.g. <span href='contributor'>authors</span> are not supposed to do user administration,
       so need not be bothered with buttons and panels for that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Therefor, you see only one workspace at a time, which contains the buttons and panels you need
       for a particular kind of work.
    </p>
    <p>
       An author can use the <a href='./content_workspace.html'>content workspace</a>
       and the <a href='./home_workspace.html'>home workspace</a>.
