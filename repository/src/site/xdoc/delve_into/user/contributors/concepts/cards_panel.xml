      <span class="shortdesc">What and where is the cards panel?</span>

    <div class='group'>

     <p>
      The cards panel. 
      <span class='rewrite'>Is for content. Call it content panel, file panel, present panel?</span>
     </p>
    </div>

    <p>
     The <i>cards panel</i> is for <a href='./edit_mode.html'>changing</a> and
     <a href='./review_mode.html'>reviewing</a> files (documents, images or assets).
     The <i>cards panel</i> holds one or more <a href='./card.html'>cards</a>.
     Each card shows a document, image or asset.
     The cards are lying on top of each other, so
     you can actually see only the upper one. But you can
     easily switch between them:
     Each card has a tab at its upper edge and tabs of all
     cards are visible at all time. You can click on a tab to put that card on top.
    </p>
    <p>The <i>cards panel</i> only exists when you have <a href='../howto/pullout_card.html'>pulled 
      out at least one card</a>
     from the repository. When you <a href='../howto/putback_card.html'>put back the last card</a>,
     the <i>cards panel</i> goes away.
     The region on your screen that was occupied by the cards panel
     may then become empty, show a nice image or show another panel.
