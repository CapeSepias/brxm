      The cards panel.
      <span class='rewrite'>Is for content.
       Call it content panel, file panel, present panel?</span>
     </p>
    </div>

    <p>
     The <i>cards panel</i> is for <a href='./edit_mode.html'>changing</a> and
     <a href='./review_mode.html'>reviewing</a> files (documents, images or assets).
     The <i>cards panel</i> holds one or more <a href='./card.html'>cards</a>.
     Each card shows a document, image or asset.
     The cards are lying on top of each other, so
     you can actually see only the upper one. But you can
     easily switch between them:
     Each card has a tab at its upper edge and tabs of all
     cards are visible at all time. You can click on a tab to put that card on top.
    </p>
    <p>The <i>cards panel</i> only exists when you have
     <span href='../howto/open_file.html'>opened at least one file</span>, which
     will be shown on a card. When you <span href='../howto/close_file.html'>close a file</span>,
     its card goes away. If you close
     the last of the opened files, the <i>cards panel</i> also goes away.
     The region on your screen that was occupied by the cards panel
     may then become empty, show a nice image or show another panel.
