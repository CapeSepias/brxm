    <section name="Document actions menu">
     <span class="shortdesc">The document actions menu is a menu of actions that can be performed
      on a specific document.</span>

   <p>
    You find the document actions menu in the <a href='review_mode.html'>review mode</a> of a document,
    at the top.
   </p>

   <p>
    In the document actions menu you can select
    <a href='../howto/show_referring_documents.html'>Show referring documents</a> to get a list
    of all documents referring to the current document.
   </p>

   <p>
    Editors have access to much more document actions: renaming, copying, moving and deleting a document.
   </p>

   <p>
    Although deleting a document is a document action to an editor,
    requesting deletion of a document is not a document action, but a miscellaneous action. You can find
    that menu also in the <a href='review_mode.html'>review mode</a> of the document.
   </p>

   <subsection name='Next'>
    <ul>
     <li>
      If you are doing the <a href='../tour.html'>tour</a>, use the back button of your browser to continue.
      (There is no hyperlink here, because you can get here from many different pages.)
     </li>
     <li><a href='../howto/show_referring_documents.html'>Show referring documents</a>.</li>
