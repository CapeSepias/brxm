    <section name="Managing users and groups">
      <p>
      The HippoECM security model is build around 4 concepts, users, groups, roles and domains. 
      Users with administrative rights can switch to the management perspective 
      to do CRUD operations on these entities. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User: representation of an end-user that can log in to the CMS. Users are member(s) of 0-n groups</li>
        <li>Group: logical categorization of users. Groups have 0-n users as members.</li>
        <li>Role: collection of permissions read, write and remove. Either can be true or false.</li>
        <li>Domain: collection of 'Auth roles' and 'Domain rules'.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Auth role: Maps a role to 0-n groups and/or users 
            </li>
            <li>
              Domain rules: todo
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <subsection name="Creating a new user">
        <p>
        Click on the 'New user' button (listing 1) in the left pane of the management perspective. A 
        text input field will appear where you can type the new user's username (listing 2). 
        Press enter to create the new user instance and load the edit user form.<br/>
        The new user will appear in the users list (left pane) with an asterisk marking it 
        as new (listing 3). 
        </p>
        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td style="padding-right: 15px;">
              <img src="../../images/tour/newuser1.png" alt="newuser"/>
              <br/>
              <em style="width:230px;display:block;">Click on the 'New user' button to add a user</em>
            </td>
            <td style="padding-right: 15px;">
              <img src="../../images/tour/newuser2.png" alt="newuser"/>
              <br/>
              <em style="width:230px;display:block;">Type in the new username and press enter to confirm</em>
            </td>
            <td style="padding-right: 15px;">

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          The new user is automatically selected which will load the edit-user-form in the
          middle pane. Above this form two buttons will appear, "ok" and "cancel".
          Pressing "ok" on a *new* user will persist it in the repository and the asterisk will 
          disappear. Clicking "cancel" on a *new* user will remove it completly. 
          <br/>
          Clicking "ok" or "cancel" on an existing user will either save all pending changes, 
          or simply unload the edit-form again.
          <br/>
          Only after a user has been persisted for the first time, you will be able to configure
          it as a member of one or more groups. You can do this by dragging a group from 
          the groups list (left pane) into the list beneath the users form.
