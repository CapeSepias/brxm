     In the <a href='./goto_user_management_workspace.html'>user management workspace</a>,
     after choosing the group administration, just before clicking to add a new
     group.
     Existing groups are admin, editor, author, everybody and inars.
     The first four groups are standard. Inars had just been added. Inars is
     described as 'Information architects', and has no members yet.
     The new group will be created with a name and optionally a description.
     It will not yet have members, and not have permissions settings.
