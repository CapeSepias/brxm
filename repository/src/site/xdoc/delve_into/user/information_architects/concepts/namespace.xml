      <span class="shortdesc">What is a namespace</span>

    <p>In general, a namespace is a named group of names that are mutually unique.
       The same name can not occur within that namespace, but it can occur outside of
       the namespace. If it is known that names are in a particular namespace,
       the name of the namespace does not have to be repeated all the time.
       Otherwise, if the name of the namespace is added to the name within the namespace,
       a generally unique name is obtained (well, within the namespace of that namespace).      
   </p>
   <p>Namespaces reflect how people normally talk: context dependent. E.g. if you talk to your spouse about
      'the children', you do not mean the same children as when somebody else talks to his
      or her spouse about 'the children'. The phrase 'the children' refers to different
      children, depending on context. A namespace is such a context. Your family name is a 
      namespace.
