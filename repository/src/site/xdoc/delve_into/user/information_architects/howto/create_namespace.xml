     <p>
      Creation of <a href='../concepts/namespace.html'>namespace</a> with short name `sar', 
      the name of the organization's online newspaper. 
      A long name is associated with it, that is supposed to be unique in
      the whole world. This long name has the form of an <a href='../concepts/URL.html'>URL</a>. 
     </p>
   </div>

   <p>
    While in the <a href='./goto_documenttypes_tab.html'>documenttypes tab</a>,
    click on the selection menu at the top of the middle-right lane and select `create namespace'
    by clicking on it. A dialog window appears.
   </p>
   <p>
    Type a name for the namespace, which may be short, as it will be used to add as a prefix to all 
    names later defined in the namespace, to make them unique. 
   </p>
   <p>
    The name for the namespace will probably not be unique in the whole world. Associate a long, unique name
    with it, that has the form of a URL. The URL does not have to exist,
    but if your organization owns a website, it is good practice to use an URL you own, as 
    that garanties it's uniqueness.
