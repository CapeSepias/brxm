    <p>
     After choosing 'Update all content' from the
     <a href='../../contributors/concepts/folder_action_menu.html'>folder action menu</a>
     of the namespace folder snp. A dialog window appears.
     </p>
   </div>

   <p>
    Update all content makes a new <a href='../concepts/documenttype.html'>document type</a>
    available for writing documents of that type.
    In case of changes to an existing document type,
    update all content will change all existing documents of that type to conform to the new
    definition. Therefor, you will always be asked if you really want to perform 'update all content'.
   </p>
   <p class='warn'>
     Before update all content is performed,
     a new document type will not be in the list of document types to choose from while
     creating a new document. Note that in a folder that is configured to allow only some document types,
     other document types will never get in that list.
   </p>

   <p class='warn'>
    Be warned that users may loose content if you use 'update all content' while users are
    already using the document type you changed, i.e. they created documents of it.
    'update all content' is no problem for a new document type or a document type
    for which no meaningful documents exists yet. However, if you go about changing document types
    that users already created documents of, you really must know what you are doing!
    If you use 'update all content', all appropriate documents will be made to comply to the new document types.
    So, if you removed a field from the type, that field will be removed from all the documents. But users
    may have written content in it that they do not want to loose. They may have wished to move that content
    to another field.
