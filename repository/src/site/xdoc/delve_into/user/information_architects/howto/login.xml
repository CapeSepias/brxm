    <p>Alice logs in to Hippo CMS. She has typed her password, but only bullets are shown,
       to prevent someone looking over her shoulder from reading it. She chose the Hippo CMS to
       be in English. Now she is about to press the button marked 'login'.
      </p>
   </div>

    <p>
     After <a href='./start_CMS.html'>starting Hippo CMS</a>, you will be presented with a login dialog.
     Type your Hippo CMS username and password. This must been given to you by your CMS administrator and
     he must have known that you are supposed to work in Hippo CMS as information architect, because he
     has to set the appropiate rights for you.
