        <p>
          While Hippo CMS can be used out of the box to manage your content, implementing
          the system in your unique environment requires some work. You will have to
          set up a front end application (website, intranet, portal) to publish your
          content to. You want to know how to integrate Hippo CMS in your enviroment.
          This section directs
          you to the right tools, and explains how to access your content through the
          repository's JCR interface.
