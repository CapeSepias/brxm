      <subsection name="Introduction">
        <p>
          Hippo ECM can be used in a wide variety of cases, and can be tailored where needed. Hippo
          does not enforce structure, although it does bring clarity in the enormous amount of
          information that users have to cope with on a day to day basis. Some of the most common usages
          are listed in this section.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Using Hippo ECM for Document Management">
        <p>
          Out of the box, Hippo ECM provides Document Management functionalities that allows users
          to share and collaborate on documents. Hippo ECM extends standard Document Management
          functionalities by allowing users to organize all information in a way that is most useful
          to themselves or to the group they participate in, without forcing anyone to use a certain
          predefined structure.
        </p>
        <p> 
          By using the Hippo ECM Faceted interface, anyone can start adding documents in no time
          without having to worry about the structure in which information should be stored. 
        </p>

      <subsection name="Using Hippo ECM for Web Content Management">
        <p>
          Hippo ECM provides one integrated environment through which you can publish your
          content to the web, whether it is on the internet, intranet, extranet or any 
          combination of those. A toolkit is available for rapid development of tailor-made 
          websites, while its use of open standards makes integration of Hippo ECM in an existing 
          environment easy and straightforward. Out of the box features like a fast and effective 
          search engine and faceted navigation let your users find the information they are looking 
          for with minimal effort, optimizing the user experience.

      <subsection name="Using Hippo ECM for Technical Documentation">
        <p>
          Content reuse and unlimited possibilities to organize your content in different ways
          make Hippo ECM particularly well suited to manage your technical documentation.
          Let your specialists maintain content such as specifications, manuals, andd part lists
          in their respective fields of knowledge, and assemble the same content into many
          different publications, based on their target audience and publication media.
          Advanced version management and authorization, and fine grained content reuse
          make sure your audience always gets tailor made and up-to-date information, through
          the web, PDF, and print.
