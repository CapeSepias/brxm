      <section name="Website Development">
        <p>
          After having set up your ECM, you may very well want to publish the contents
          of the repository by means of a website. This means that your website has to connect to
          the repository. As the repository is Java Content Repository (JCR) compliant,
          Java clients using this standard can communicate with the repository, see <a href="jcr.html">JCR Interface</a>.
          Besides that, Hippo has developed a library on top of the JCR layer
          that is called the <code>Hippo Site Toolkit</code>, which is targeted at JSP clients,
          for easy website development.
        </p>

       <subsection name="Using Hippo Site Toolkit">
          <p>
            For the purpose of fast site development, Hippo has developed the Hippo Site Toolkit,
            or the HST for short, targeted at JSP frontends. It features: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>An expression language to retrieve repository content, using JSP 2.0's standard JSTL
              Expression Language (<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/JSPIntro7.html" target="_blank">see here</a>).
              On how to use it, <a href="hst/el-index.html">see here</a>.</li>
            <li>A servlet for serving binaries like images, <a href="hst/binaries.html">see here</a>.</li>
            <li>The possibility to use URL mapping, i.e. use the URL to locate content and
              subsequently find it's view page, <a href="hst/url-mapping.html">see here</a>.</li>
            <li>A jsp tag library for higher level repository access functionality, <a href="hst/jsp-taglib.html">see here</a>.</li>
          </ul>
         <p>See <a href="hst/include.html">including the HST</a> on how to include the HST in your application.</p>
         <p>See <a href="hst/configuration.html">HST configuration</a> on how to set up and configure the HST.</p>
         <p>See <a href="hst/configuration-example.html">configuration example</a> for an example web.xml.</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection name="Running the sample HST site">
            <p>The show the possiblities of the HST in practice, a complete JSP site has been
              made available for download. It is in fact the currently running
              <a href="http://www.onehippo.com" target="_blank">onehippo.com</a> website.
              To run it, you also need a combined CMS 7 / Repository 2
               with initial content in it.</p>
             <p>On how to run the example site, <a href="hst/running-sample-site.html">see here</a>.</p>
