      <section name="Running the HST example site">
        <p>The show the possiblities of the HST in practice, a complete JSP site has been 
          made available for download. It is in fact the currently running 
          <a href="http://www.onehippo.com" target="_blank">onehippo.com</a> website.  
          To run it, you also need a combined CMS 7 / Repository 2
          with initial content in it. </p>
        
        <subsection name="Download and run example Repository 2 / CMS 7.">
          <h4>Download</h4>
          <p>Download the <a href="/onehippo-ecm-1.01.00.war">onehippo.com ECM as a war</a>.</p>
          <h4>Run</h4>
          <p>Deploy the war in your favorite web server, like Tomcat or JBoss.  
            <a href="/run-hippo-ecm/index.html">See here</a> for more information on
            deploying the ECM.</p>
        </subsection>  
        
        <subsection name="Download and run the HST example site.">
          <h4>Download</h4>
          <p>Download the <a href="/onehippo-site-1.01.00.war">onehippo.com site as a war</a>.</p>
          <h4>Running</h4>
          <p>Deploy the war in your favorite web server. The current distribution assumes that
            the following components are provided:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Java Transaction API (JTA)</strong>, normally provided
              by the web server. If your web server lacks it, like Tomcat does, you may want to
              install for instance Geronimo's <code>geronimo-spec-jta-1.0.1B-rc2.jar</code>. It 
              may be obtained under through the <a href="http://geronimo.apache.org">Apache 
              Geronimo project</a> as with Maven 2 groupID <code>geronimo-spec</code> and 
              artifactId <code>geronimo-spec-jta</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard core and formatting taglibs</strong>: the example site uses 
              two standard taglibs, core (<code>c:</code>) and formatting (<code>fmt:</code>).
              These taglibs should be provided by the container and may be obtained
              through the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/"> Apache Jakarta project</a>.
              The version should be 1.1.2 or higher.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Running on Tomcat</h4>
          <p>If you are running the site in Tomcat, the above components can be   
            installed in Tomcat's <code>shared/lib</code> directory.</p>
