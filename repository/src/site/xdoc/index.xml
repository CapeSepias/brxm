        The Hippo Content Management System is one component of the 
        Hippo ECM.
        With Hippo CMS information can be: created, acquired, structured, managed,
        stored, preserved, shared, printed, searched and published on the web as a flat website.

 <!--
        Any applications conforming to the JCR API can be linked to Hippo CMS. 
        >> That is linking to the repository, but what about to Hippo CMS itself?
