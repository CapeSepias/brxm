        <p>
          Hippo is targeted at medium to large organizations managing content for multi-channel distribution
          like web sites, intranet and print. It facilitates an open and flexible way of using your information
          by following internationally accepted open standards.<br/><br/>
          <b>Hippo differentiates itself from other ECM and CMS systems by its clean separation of content storage, management and presentation.</b>
