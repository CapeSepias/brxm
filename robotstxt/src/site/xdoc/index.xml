      <subsection name="Functionality">
        <p>
          The robotstxt plugin adds a special document type to the CMS,
          allowing webmasters to determine the content of the robots.txt file
          retrieved by webbots. See <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robotstxt.org</a>
          for more information on the format and purpose of that file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The robotstxt plugin provides Beans and Components for retrieving the
          robots.txt-related data from the Hippo repository, and a sample JSP
          file for rendering that data into the robots.txt file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plugin comes with a <a href="demo.html">demo-project</a>, illustrating the use of the plugin.
        </p>

          <p>
            Below is a screenshot of the CMS' document editor, where the content
            of the robots.txt file(s) can be entered / modified.

          <p>
            By default, the robotstxt plugin disallows all URLs pertaining to a preview-site, if such a site should
            be exposed publicly, such that search engines do not index preview sites.
