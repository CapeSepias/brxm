            <p>
                When upgrading from an older version of the Robots.txt plugin, you
                have to update the dependencies of your project's cms and site modules
                to the new plugin version.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your previous robotstxt related HST configuration may have involved embedding a JSP file and
                setting up a hst:page and a hst:template. With the latest version of the plug-in, this is no
                longer necessary. After upgrading, you may want to make sure that your sitemap item points to
                the <code>hst:default/hst:pages/robotstxt</code> page, and subsequently remove your old
                hst:pages and hst:templates configuration, as well as the old jsp file, unless you made
                project-specific adjustments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rebuild and restart your project.
