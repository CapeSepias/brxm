intro=<p>This URL design is for URLs ending in the level pattern specified below. The previous levels of the URL are defined by the previous levels of the URL designs. The allowed patterns are *, **, *.html, **.html and a specific name. Add a test child URL design to get more explanations.</p><p>A URL is an address for a web page. The destination web page consists of information presented according to the web page design. You may specify a content path for content in the CMS. Many web page designs use content that is somehow related to the content path. Web page designs that are not meant to present content from the CMS ignore the content path.</p>
