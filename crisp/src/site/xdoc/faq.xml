      <subsection name="Q: Can I use CRISP in non-CMS delivery / authoring tier applciations?">
        <p>
          Yes, <code>CRISP</code> API and CORE is basically independent from CMS specific APIs.
          However, you will need to include all the <strong>provided</strong> dependencies referred by
          <code>CRISP</code> API and <code>CRISP</code> Core by yourself in your application.

      <subsection name="Q: Which is more crispy, granny apples or CRISP?">
        <p>
          Depends. If you're more interested in baking or cooking than programming, perhaps granny apples look
          more crispy, but if you have struggled with implementing backend integrations in content delivery or
          authoring tier on and on, probably you will pick <strong>CRISP</strong>.
