        <p>
          The poll plug-in provides a <code>Poll</code> document type out of the box. It is a simple wrapper around the poll
          compound, which defines the core data of the poll document.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can create your own poll document type(s) in the Configuration section of the CMS Browse workspace.
          Your document type should directly include the poll compound provided by the poll plug-in, and may contain
          any more fields you desire. When working with your own poll document type, you will have to provide a HST
          bean representing your document type. Also see the <a href="parameters.html">poll-docsClass and
          poll-pollCompoundName</a> parameters of the poll component.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Creating Poll documents">
        <p>
          A poll document is a document with a 'multiple' field to hold all the available options a poll has (the
          possible answers). To create a new poll, navigate to the the Documents section of the CMS Browse workspace.
          We'll create a new Poll document in there. From the context menu of the folder, select 'Add new document'.
          Provide a name, optionally a URL name and in the 'Document type' dropdown select 'Poll'. Click ok and the
          document editor opens to edit the new Poll document.
        </p>
        <img src="images/new poll.jpg"/>
        <p>
          Now you should fill in the properties of your new poll document. The default template for rendering this data
          always shows the <i>text</i> (both when inviting to vote and when presenting the votes). The <i>introduction</i>
          is only shown when inviting to vote. Only <i>active</i> poll documents are available for rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiple <i>Options</i> field stores your answers. The <i>value</i> attribute is used internally in the
          repository for book-keeping, while the <i>label</i> attribute is typically rendered to the webpage. The
          rendering code has access to both attributes.
        </p>
        <img src="images/new poll document.jpg"/>
        <p>
          The next step requires that you have created at least one poll document.
