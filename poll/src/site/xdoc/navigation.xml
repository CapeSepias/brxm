        Like any other page or component, the content is made available on the site by ensuring there is a
        sitemap item referring to the component created in the previous step. You do this in the URL and Navigation
        Management area of the CMS Channel Manager. In the sitemap section, create a new entry corresponding to
        the desired URL, set the <i>level pattern</i> to refer to the top level page containing your component
        and point the <i>Content path</i> to your poll document.
      </p>
      <img src="images/sitemap-item.jpg" alt="Sitemap Item"/>
      <p>
        The above defines an URL for your poll, which you can now use to link to from other pages and/or menus.
