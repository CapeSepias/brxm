Instructions for the translator: 

- Do not translate the values in the first column 
- Only translate the text from the second column and place the translation in the third column 
- The texts are used in a software system where on run-time parts of the text are replaced with a value.
  These replacements are marked with "{someKey}" or '{{someKey}}'. Keep these parts EXACTLY as they are,
  including the quotes. 
- Be aware that your text editor may be configured to change straight quotes ("" or '') into fancy curly
  quotes (“” or ‘’). This is NOT correct! The quotes must remain as they are.
- In a few cases a translation is already available: please check if it is correct. Update if necessary.
  It may be that the original English text was updated, and then the translation must be updated also.
