            <p>
            	This guide contains two sections. In the first section we will look at the tagging plugin
            	itself. This is useful if you what to modify the inner workings or want to extend the plugin.
            </p>
            <p>
            	In the second section we will look a writing your very own tagging provider. You won't need any
            	knowledge of the tagging plugin itself. A tagging provider is a plugin for the tagging framework 
            	which can suggest tags for a document. <br />
            	In the tagging plugin every provider inspects the document and makes a suggestion (if it can) 
            	for some tags for the document. <br />
            	If you have you own (complex) document type and want to add some tagging capability you can just
            	add a provider for some property of the document.
