      <p>
        The demo project depends on the latest snapshot (trunk) of the plugin. So you can either set the version in your
        demo to the latest release or build the plugin locally. For the latter, check out the trunk source code from the
        SVN repository:
      </p>
      <source>$ svn co https://forge.onehippo.org/svn/relateddocs/relateddocs/trunk/ relateddocs-trunk</source>
      <p>
        Build the project using Maven:
      </p>
      <source>$ cd relateddocs-trunk
$ mvn clean install</source>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Check out, build and run the demo project">
      <p>
        Check out the trunk source code from the SVN repository:
      </p>
      <source>$ svn co https://forge.onehippo.org/svn/relateddocs/relateddocs-demo/trunk relateddocs-demo-trunk</source>
      <p>
        If you didn't build the plugin locally, set the correct release version in the root pom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Build and run the demo project:
      </p>
      <source>$ cd relateddocs-demo-trunk
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn -P cargo.run</source>
