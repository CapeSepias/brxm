intro: <p>A region design can reference another region design. Then all ingredients from the referenced region design are reused here. You can add more parameters to fine tune the region design.</p><p>Otherwise, you specify a component class name and a template. The component class defines what information is shown in the region and the template defines how that information is shown in the region (the layout and the looks).</p><p>Again you can fine tune by parameters. The possible names and values of the parameters depend on the component class.</p><p>Add an annotation to this region design for future reference! Type a description. In your browser, go to the site, make a screenshot of a region designed by this design and upload it as a thumbnail. In that way site configurators will see at a glance what your design is for.</p>
