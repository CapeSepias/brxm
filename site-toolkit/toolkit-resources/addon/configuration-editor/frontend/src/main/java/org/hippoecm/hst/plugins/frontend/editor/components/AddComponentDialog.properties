dialog.intro: A building block is a region design that is not a complete page and that has a name of its own. Invent a name for the new building block. Other region designs may use this building block by referring to it by its name. The set of building blocks offers a library of region designs that each may be used in many page designs. This may occur via many levels of containers. Page designs can be selected in URL designs, while building blocks can not.
