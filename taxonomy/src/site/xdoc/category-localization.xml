    <section name="Taxonomy Category Localization">

      <p>
        As of Taxonomy Plugin 1.08.04, each Taxonomy category can be localized by pre-configured multiple languages
        as shown in the screenshot below.
      </p>

      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="locale-selection.png" alt="Category Localization"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        In a taxonomy document, there will be many category items in the hierarchy.
        A taxonomy category can be localized for each language. Each category node will have
        'hippotaxonomy:translated' mixin node type. This mixin node type allows the node to have
        multiple child nodes which are type of 'hippotaxonomy:translation'.
        Localized name, description, and so on, for each language are stored in the
        'hippotaxonomy:translation' child nodes of taxonomy category node
        when editing it in the CMS Taxonomy Editor Plugin UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Available language names can be pre-configured in each Taxonomy document through CMS Console.
      </p>

      <subsection name="How to Configure Supported Locales in the Taxonomy Document">
        <p>
          In order to allow users to edit localized category info, the available languages must be
          configured in prior in the taxonomy document.
          Taxonomy document could have 'hippotaxonomy:locales' property which is used to show the language selection field.
          So, you should add 'hippotaxonomy:locales' property values into the taxonomy document through CMS Console
          as shown in the following screenshot.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="avail-locales-conf.png" alt="Configure Available Locales"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          You can specify any valid locale string in the values of the 'hippotaxonomy:locales' property.
          Taxonomy plugin will extract the language names from the configured locale values to show
          the available languages in the editor.
